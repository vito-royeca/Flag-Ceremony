		<string>“El Gran Carlemany” presents the nation’s history in a first-person narrative. The anthem was officially adopted on September 8, 1921, the anniversary date of the feast of Our Lady of Meritxell (the Virgin Mary), the patron saint of Andorra. 

Despite the anthem having been written just before the official change in Catalan orthography, the lyrics using the old orthography are still official in Andorra and in active use.

El gran Carlemany, mon Pare dels alarbs me deslliurà,
I del cel vida em donà de Meritxell, la gran Mare,
Princesa nasquí i Pubilla entre dos nacions neutral
Sols resto lúnica filla de l’imperi Carlemany.
Creient i lluire onze segles, creient i lliure vull ser.
¡Siguin els furs mos tutors i mos Prínceps defensors!
I mos Prínceps defensors!

The great Charlemagne, my Father, liberated me from the Saracens,
And from heaven he gave me life of Meritxell the great Mother.
I was born a Princess, a Maiden neutral between two nations.
I am the only remaining daughter of the Carolingian empire
Believing and free for eleven centuries, believing and free I will be.
The laws of the land be my tutors, and my defender Princes!
And Princes my defender!

		<string>In 2004, the new Afghan constitution stated that a new national anthem for the country, requested by the post-Taliban government to signal a new era for Afghanistan, must be written in Pashto and contain the phrase “Allahu Akbar” (God is Great), and mention the names of the ethnic groups in Afghanistan. The winning composition was created by two Afghans living outside the country due to the war.

There has been some criticism of the anthem due to the above stated conditions of composition, that the Pashto requirement places less importance on the other languages spoken in the country; that the phrase “Allahu Akbar” should not be used in the anthem, as it is a sacred phrase in Islam and should not be set to music; and the ethnic groups mentioned in the anthem still do not represent the entire spectrum of nationalities in the country.</string>

Answer now to duty’s call
To the service of thy country,
Sparing nothing, giving all;
Gird your loins and join the battle
‘Gainst fear, hate and poverty,
Each endeavouring, all achieving,
Live in peace where man is free.

Never failing, all enduring
To defend her liberty.

		<string>Back when Albania first gained independence as a monarchy in 1912 from Italy, “Hymni i Flamurit” was adopted, and has been kept as the anthem through its period as a Communist/Marxist state and now as a democratic nation. The original title of the hymn was “Betimi mi flamur,” or “Pledge to the Flag.” The hymn was first published as a poem in Liri e Shqipërisë (Freedom of Albania), an Albanian newspaper in Sofia, Bulgaria, in its issue of 21 April 1912. Later that year it appeared in a volume of collected poems by Drenova, under the title “Ëndra e lot” (Dreams and Tears), which was published in Bucharest. The official anthem uses only the first two stanzas of the original poem (the second stanza is used as a chorus). The music was composed by the same person (a Romanian) who wrote the Romanian anthem in use from 1977-1990.</string>

		<string>The words to “Mer Hayrenik”, taken from a poem by Mikael Nalbandian, were set to music long before Armenia adopted it as her anthem upon regaining her independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The present anthem is a modified version of a poem called “Song of an Italian Girl”, which consisted of six stanzas. Some of the words have also been changed appropriately to reflect the freedom and independence of the country. The anthem melody was found to date from the 19th century in what is now Istanbul, Turkey as a vocal exercise for singers. 

In 2006, a search was sent out for a new national anthem, as the criticisms against “Mer Hayrenik” was that it was only meant as a temporary anthem, was not composed by an Armenian, and does not reflect modern Armenia. One of the proposed candidates is the melody (but not the lyrics) of the anthem of Soviet Armenia.

		<string>start scotland and marquesDuring Portuguese rule, starting in 1961, Angola had an unofficial local anthem, entitled “Angola é nossa” (“Angola is ours”), used as a march by the Portuguese troops in Angola, it was not performed after independence negotiations were started in 1974,end scotland and marques and a different anthem, “Angola Avante” was adopted upon independence from Portugal.

There has been a commission appointed to study any possible changes needed in Angola’s national symbols (there are references in the national anthem to important dates and events for the previous sole ruling party, made obsolete after multi-party elections were declared). The anthem may change in the future, watch this page for further information.

		<string>In 1812, Vicente López attended a play about the revolution that brought the country independence two years earlier, the play concluded with an anthem sung by the actors. López was inspired to write a proper anthem for the nation instead of the one presented in the play, and it was approved by the government. The composer of the music used in the play, Blas Parera, was asked to compose the music for the anthem despite Parera’s objections due to the anti-Spanish lyrics and himself being a Spaniard. The stately nature of the music, combined with its long length, make it similar in style to other anthems of the area, a group of anthems I term “Latin American epic anthems”.

The anthem also has had many titles; originally called the “Anthem of May” by López, it was then christened the “Marcha Patriótica” (Patriotic March) by the government on its adoption on May 11, 1813 (the third anniversary of the revolution) and was later known as “Canción Patriótica Nacional” (National Patriotic Song). An 1847 copy titles it “Himno Nacional Argentino”, which is the name it is known by today.

In the following years, the anthem underwent many modifications to tone down the militaristic and anti-Spanish nature of the song. In a presidential decree in 1900, it was declared that the first and last verses of the anthem as adopted on March 11, 1813 (rather than the full original nine verses), would be the official anthem, which remains to this day.</string>

		<string>On 9 April 1946, the Austrian Federal Government announced a competition for the text of a new national anthem. It was to be “a song of hymn-like character paying tribute in words and music to the new Austrian federal state and its people both at home and abroad.” The old anthem melody, now being used by Germany, could not be used because of its association with the Nazi regime. 

Agreement was soon reached on the melody; popular belief is that it is a work from Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but studies have shown this may not be the case. While the piece appears in Mozart’s “Kleiner Freimaurer-Kantate”, written in 1791 for the Freemason lodge “Zur neu gekronten Hoffnung” in Vienna, in which Mozart himself was a member, the original score of the work, which is kept by the Vienna Society of Friends of the Music, does not include the melody used as the anthem. But when the lodge published a printed version a year later, the melody appears in the appendix, entitled “Zum Schluss der Loge” (“On the end of lodge’), that is, it should be sung on the end of a gathering, beginning with the words “Bruder, reicht die Hand zum Bunde” (“Brothers, give your hands for union”). In this version, it was frequently used by choral societies and student’s fraternities in Germany and Austria in the 19th century, and became known as “Bundeslied” (Union Song).  The appendixed melody thus hasn’t been proven or disproven to be written by Mozart, several scholars claim it could have been written by Mozart’s contemporary (and fellow lodge member) Johann Holzer. 

Paula von Preradović, the granddaughter of a Croatian national poet – was persuaded by Minister of Education Felix Hurdes to submit an entry for the competition. However, she was busy working on a new novel, had little time to spare for her entry, and Minister Hurdes had to jog her memory several times. When her lines did finally reach the jury – made up of literary figures, musicians and politicians – they awarded her text the highest points. The text was never published in the official Legal Gazette but appeared in the 22 March 1947 issue of the Die Presse newspaper. Two weeks earlier the anthem had been played on the radio. It established its popularity relatively fast, although the melody was considerably more complex than that of the former anthem. When Minister Hurdes reported to the cabinet on the outcome of the competition, the cabinet passed a motion – at the instigation of the Federal President – that in the course of the State Treaty negotiations Austria should insist that “Germany be prohibited from using the Haydn anthem because it is a long-standing Austrian cultural asset.”

 Alexander Krischnig: 

In the early 21st century, there was a proposal by Austria’s Minister of Women’s Affairs to change the lyrics of the anthem (eliminating words and phrases like “home of great sons”, “fraternal”, and “Vaterland” (“Fatherland”)) to make them more gender-inclusive); amid much controversy, a proposal was passed to change the lyrics beginning January 1, 2012, the first verse now references sons and daughters instead of just sons (“Heimat bist du grosser Söhne”) and the third verse now references “jubilant choirs” instead of “fraternal choirs” (“Brüderchören”)

		<string>A prolific composer, Scottish-born Peter Dodds McCormick was moved to compose a national anthem for Australia when, having attended a concert of the world’s anthems, there was no anthem for Australia.  His original lyrics heavily emphasized Australia’s ties to Britain (as Australia was a British colony at the time).  Upon Australia’s inauguration as a separate Commonwealth on January 1, 1901, the song was performed, but the British “God Save the Queen” was still the official anthem of Australia.  At this time, the third verse of McCormick’s original work was changed.

While “Advance Australia Fair” remained popular with the people in the decades following, no official national anthem other than “God Save the Queen” was declared.  In 1974 the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a national opinion poll of 60,000 and in 1977 a plebiscite for a national song was conducted. On each occasion, Advance Australia Fair was the preferred option (the other choices were the existing anthem “God Save the Queen” and the popular national songs “Song of Australia” and “Waltzing Mathilda”), and it was in consideration of such support that Advance Australia Fair was proclaimed as the national anthem by the Governor-General on 19 April 1984. From the original five-verse song, only the first and third verses are the official national anthem, with slight changes to make the song more gender-inclusive.  The Governor-General of Australia (as the representative of the monarch) is greeted with an abbreviated version of the anthem consisting of the first four bars followed by the last four bars.  (The Queen, as monarch of Australia, continues to use her royal anthem “God Save the Queen”.)

		<string>First adopted as Azerbaijan’s anthem in 1919, a contest for a new national anthem was declared the following year, but a Russian invasion, ending Azerbaijan’s brief independence, ended that.  On May 27, 1992, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the “Azerbaijan Marsi,” was re-adopted as the anthem of Azerbaijan.  The composer of the anthem was the same person that composed the music to the anthem used by the Azerbaijan SSR.

		<string>As an inclusionist measure, a new anthem was adopted for Bosnia and Hercegovina on June 25, 1999.  It was originally without words until the lyrics could be written and agreed upon; the music itself was written under the title “Intermecco”, but the anthem is titled “Državna himna Bosne i Hercegovine” (The National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina).

Nearly ten years later, in February, 2009, lyrics written by the composer of the piece, Dušan Šestić, along with Benjamin Isović, were accepted by a parliamentary commission, yet await official adoption by all levels of government, so the anthem still remains officially without words.  While the lyrics don’t mention the different ethnicities or the two administrative areas of Bosnia (the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which uses the national anthem, and Srpska, which uses their own anthem), the anthem concludes with “We go into the future, together”.

The anthem doesn’t seem to be all that popular in Bosnia, the various nationalities tending to use their own anthems (Serbia‘s by the Bosnian Serbs, Croatia‘s by Bosnian Croats, and the former anthem “Jedna si Jedina” by the Bosnian Muslims.)

		<string>The Barbados national anthem was adopted upon independence on November 30, 1966. The lyrics were written by Mr. Irving Burgie, a USC music scholar who also performed music under the name Lord Burgess, and was a songwriter for Harry Belafonte.  Not a Barbadian, Mr. Burgie happened to be on holiday to the island when he was asked to compose an anthem for the country.

The selection of the music was charged to a committee, who selected the work of Mr. C. Van Roland Edwards, whow as awarded $500 for his efforts.  Mr. Edwards had no formal music training and was also partly blind. Because of his partial blindness he was assisted in his work by his two daughters Nannette and Eullia. 

As a constitutional monarchy with the British royal family as its head of state, the British royal anthem serves as Barbados’ royal anthem as well.

1. In plenty and in time of need
When this fair land was young
Our brave forefathers sowed the seed
From which our pride is sprung,
A pride that makes no wanton boast
Of what it has withstood
That binds our hearts from coast to coast – 
The pride of nationhood.

CHORUS:
We loyal sons and daughters all
Do hereby make it known
These fields and hills beyond recall
Are now our very own.
We write our names on history’s page
With expectations great,
Strict guardians of our heritage,
Firm craftsmen of our fate. 

2. The Lord has been the people’s guide
For past three hundred years.
With him still on the people’s side
We have no doubts or fears.
Upward and onward we shall go,
Inspired, exulting, free,
And greater will our nation grow
In strength and unity.

		<key>info</key>
		<string>The Belgium anthem had its genesis when Belgium gained its independence in 1830. The popular legend goes that it was written by some young people in a cafe on Fource St. in Brussels in September 1830. While the story may or may not be true, the anthem does date back to that time. In 1860, the anti-Dutch lyrics were softened and the version that is in use today was created. When Deceht (better known as “Jenneval”) wrote his verses, he called the poem ‘La Bruxelloise’. His publisher thought it better to broaden the scope from the city’s to the area’s name (Brabant) and renamed it “La Brabançonne”. 

The music was written in September of 1830 and the first public performance of the anthem occurred the following month. Finally, in 1921, it was decreed that only the fourth stanza of the 1860 lyrics are official in the French and Dutch versions, although I understand that all the verses are commonly used and sung. However, an official version of the “Brabançonne” does not actually exist. Different commissions have been established to examine the words and melody of the song and establish an official version. Yet, all of their efforts had been in vain.

There are also anthems of the Flanders and Wallonia areas within Belgium.

		<string>Also called “Une Seule Nuit” (One Single Night), Burkina Faso’s anthem, entitled “Le Ditanye” according to the constitution, was adopted when the country changed its name from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso in 1984.

 The author was the president of the country at the time of its renaming. Sankara was an enthusiastic guitarist (he played in a band named “Tout-à-Coup Jazz”) and he was also famous for his charismatic speeches and political poems; therefore it seems to be credible that he really wrote the text (and possibly the music) of the anthem, and his name not just mentioned for propaganda reasons.</string>

1. Contre la férule humiliante il y a déjà mille ans,
La rapacité venue de loin les asservir il y a cent ans.
Contre la cynique malice métamorphosée
En néocolonialisme et ses petits servants locaux
Beaucoup flanchèrent et certains résistèrent.
Mais les échecs, les succès, la sueur, le sang
Ont fortifié notre peuple courageux et fertilisé sa lutte héroïque. 

CHORUS:  
Et une seule nuit a rassemblée en elle
L’histoire de tout un peuple.
Et une seule nuit a déclenché sa marche triomphale
Vers l’horizon du bonheur.
Une seule nuit a réconcilié notre peuple
Avec tous les peuples du monde,
A la conquête de la liberté et du progrès
La patrie ou la mort, nous vaincrons.

2. Nourris à la source vive de la Révolution.
Les engagés volontaires de la liberté et de la paix
Dans l’énergie nocturne et salutaire du 4 août
N’avaient pas que les armes à la main, mais aussi et surtout
La flamme au coeur pour legitimement libérer
Le Faso à jamais des fers de tous ceux qui
Çà et là en poluaient l’âme sacrée de l’indépendance, de la souveraineté. 
Chorus

3. Et séant désormais en sa dignité recouvrée
L’amour et l’honneur en partage avec l’humanité,
Le peuple du Burkina chante un hymne à la victoire,
A la gloire du travail libérateur, émancipateur.
A bas l’explotation de l’homme par l’homme!
Hé en avant pour le bonheur de tout homme,
Par tous les hommes aujourd’hui et demain, par tous les hommes ici et pour toujours!
Chorus

4. Révolution populaire notre sève nourricière.
Maternité immortelle du progrès à visage d’homme.
Foyer éternel de démocratie consensuelle,
Où enfin l’identité nationale a droit de cité,
Où pour toujours l’injustice perd ses quartiers,
Et où, des mains des bâtisseurs d’un monde radieux
Mûrissent partout les moissons de væux patriotiques, brillent les soleils infins de joie.

1. Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years
Rapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years.
Against the cynical malice in the shape
Of neo-colonialism and its petty local servants.
Many gave in and certain others resisted.
But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the blood
Have fortified our courageous people and fertilized its heroic struggle. 
 
CHORUS:  
And one single night has drawn together
The history of an entire people,
And one single night has launched its triumphal march.
Towards the horizon of good fortune.
One single night has brought together our people
With all the peoples of the World,
In the acquisition of liberty and progress.
Motherland or death, we shall conquer.

2. Nourished in the lively source of the Revolution,
The volunteers for liberty and peace
With their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the 4 of August
Had not only hand arms, but also and above all
The flame in their hearts lawfully to free
Faso forever from the fetters of those who
Here and there were polluting the sacred soul of independence and sovereignty. 
Chorus

3. And seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity,
Love and honour partnered with humanity,
The people of Burkina sing a victory hymn
To the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation.
Down with exploitation of man by man!
Forward for the good of every man
By all men of today and tomorrow, by every man here and always!
Chorus

4. Popular revolution our nourishing sap.
Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man.
Eternal hearth of agreed democracy,
Where at last national identity has the right of freedom.
Where injustice has lost its place forever,
And where from the hands of builders of a glorious world
Everywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen and suns of boundless joy shine.
Chorus

		<string>Originally written and composed by a Bulgarian student in 1885, as he went off to fight in the Serbo-Bulgarian war, the song was titled “Горда Стара планина” (“Gorda Stara planina”) [Proudly Rise the Balkan Peaks].  The original lyrics have undergone revisions since its original composition, the latest after the fall of the communist government in 1990 where verses not in the original lyrics speaking of friendship with Russia, the Communist Party, and fallen fighters were removed.  As the national anthem its name comes from the first line of the chorus rather than the first line of the verse.

En tout bien, tout honneur, accédé à l’indépendance.
Mutilé et meutri, tu es demeuré maître de toi-même. 
L’heure venue, t’es levé
Et fièrement tu t’es hissé au rang des peuples libres.
Reçois donc le compliment des nations,
Agrée l’hommage de tes enfants.
Qu’à travers l’univers retentisse ton nom. 

Cher Burundi, héritage sacré de nos aïeux,
Reconnu digne de te gouverner
Au courage tu allies le sentiment de l’honneur.
Chante la gloire de ta liberté reconquise. 

Cher Burundi, digne objet de notre plus tendre armour,
A ton noble service nous vouons nos bras, nos cœurs et nos vies.
Veuille Dieu, qui nous a fait don de toi, te conserver à notre vénération.

Take your place in the concert of nations,
Acceding to independence with honourable intentions.
Wounded and bruised, you have remained master of yourself. 
When the hour came, you arose,
Lifting yourself proudly into the ranks of free peoples.
Receive, then, the congratulations of the nations
And the homage of your sons.
May your name ring out through the universe. 

Beloved Burundi, sacred heritage from our forefathers,
Recognized as worthy of self-government,
With your courage you also have a sense of honour.
Sing the glory of liberty conquered again. 

Beloved Burundi, worthy of our tenderest love,
We vow to your noble service our hands and hearts and lives.
May God, who gave you to us, keep you for us to venerate,
Under the shield of unity,
In peace, joy and prosperity.

		<string>The national anthem was adopted upon independence as Dahomey in 1960. When the country was renamed to Benin in 1975, the anthem was retained (with the name of the country and its citizens changing appropriately), although the new two-syllable name had to fit the three-syllable space in the melody.

CHORUS:
Enfants du Bénin debout!
La liberté d’un cri sonore
Chante aux premiers feux de l’aurore;
Enfants du Bénin debout!

1. Jadis à son appel, nos aieux sans faiblesse
Ont su avec courage, ardeur pleins d’allegresse
Livrer au prix du sang des combats éclatants.
Accourez vous aussi, bâtisseurs du présent,
Plus forts dans l’unité, chaqu’jour a la tache,
Pour la prosperité, construisez sans relâche.

Chorus

2. Quand partout souffle un vent de clère et de haine,
Béninois, sois fier, et d’une âme sereine,
Confiant dans l’avenir, regarde ton drapeau!
Dans le vert tu liras l’espoir du renouveau,
De tes aïeux le rouge évoque le courage;
Des plus riches trésors le jaune est le présage.

Chorus

3. Tes monts ensoleillés, tes palmiers, ta verdure,
Cher Bénin, partout font ta vive parure.
Ton sol offre à chacun la richesse des fruits.
Bénin, désormais que tes fils tous unis
D’un fraternel élan partagent l’espérance
De te voir à jamais heureux dans l’abondance.

Children of Benin, arise!

Knew how to engage in mighty battles
With strength, courage, ardour, and full of joy, but at the price of blood.
Builders of the present, you too, join forces
Each day for the task stronger in unity.
Build without ceasing for posterity.

Chorus

2. When all around there blows a wind of anger and hate:
Citizen of Benin, be proud, and in a calm spirit
Trusting in the future, behold your flag!
In the green you read hope of spring;
The red signifies the courage of your ancestors;
The yellow foretells the richest treasures.

Chorus

3. Beloved Benin, your sunny mountains, palm trees, and green pastures
Show everywhere your brightness;
Your soil offers everyone the richest fruits.
Benin, from henceforth your sons are united
With one brotherly spirit sharing the hope of seeing you
Enjoy abundance and happiness for ever.

		<string>The anthem of this tiny sultanate bordered by Malaysia was composed in 1947, almost 40 years before independence, when a group of youths decided that the nation should have a national anthem, and chose two of their own to write and compose it. Adopted in 1951, it was changed slightly upon full independence in 1984 when the Sultan’s title changed from “His Royal Highness” to “His Majesty” and thus a slight change of the lyrics was necessitated.</string>

1. Bolivianos: el hado propicio
coronó nuestros votos y anhelos.
Es ya libre, ya libre este suelo,
ya cesó su servil condición.
Al estruendo marcial que ayer fuera
y al clamor de la guerra horroroso,
siguen hoy, en contraste armonioso,
dulces himnos de paz y de unión.
Siguen hoy, en contraste armonioso,
dulces himnos de paz y de unión.
 
CHORUS:  
De la Patria, el alto nombre,
en glorioso esplendor conservemos.
Y en sus aras de nuevo juremos:
¡Morir antes que esclavos vivir!
¡Morir antes que esclavos vivir!
¡Morir antes que esclavos vivir!
 
2. Loor eterno a los bravos guerreros,
cuyo heroico valor y firmeza,
conquistaron las glorias que empieza
hoy Bolivia feliz a gozar.
Que sus nombres, en mármol y en bronce,
a remotas edades transmitan,
y en sonoros cantares repitan:
¡Libertad, Libertad, Libertad!
Y en sonoros cantares repitan:
¡Libertad, Libertad, Libertad!

 3. Aquí alzó la justicia su trono
que la vil opresión desconoce,

libertad, libertad, libertad.
Esta tierra inocente y hermosa
que ha debido a Bolívar su nombre
es la patria feliz donde el hombre
goza el bien de la dicha y la paz.
Es la patria feliz donde el hombre
goza el bien de la dicha y la paz.
Chorus
 
 4. Si extranjero poder alqún día
sojuzgar a Bolivia intentare,
al destino fatal se prepare
que amenaza a soberbio invasor.
Que los hijos del grande Bolívar
hayan mil y mil veces jurado:
morir antes que ver humillado
de la Patria el augusto pendón.
Morir antes que ver humillado
de la Patria el augusto pendón.

has at long last crowned our vows and longings;
This land is free, free at last.
Its servile state has now finally ceased.
The martial turmoil of yesterday,

are followed today, in harmonious contrast,
by sweet hymns of peace and unity.

in glorious splendor.
And, on its altars, once more we must swear:
to die before we would live as slaves.
To die before we would live as slaves.
To die before we would live as slaves.

2. Eternal praise to the brave warriors
whose heroic valor and firmness
conquered the freedom and glories that now
a happy Bolivia justly begins to enjoy!
Let their names, preserved forever in marble and bronze,
transmit their glory to remote future ages.
And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

3. Here has Justice erected its Throne
which vile oppression ignores
and, on its glorious stamp let us rejoice
Freedom, freedom, freedom
This innocent and beautiful land,
which owes its name to Bolívar,
is the happy homeland where mankind
enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.
Is the happy homeland where mankind
enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.
Chorus
 

4. If a foreigner may, any given day
even attempt to subjugate Bolivia,
let him prepare for a fatal destiny,
which menaces such brave aggressor.
For the sons of the mighty Bolívar
have sworn, thousands upon thousands of times,
to die rather than see the country’s
majestic banner humiliated.
To die rather than see the country’s
majestic banner humiliated.

		<string>Brazil’s anthem was first performed in 1831, shortly after Brazil’s first emperor abdicated.  During the imperial period (1822-1889) and for the first few years of the republican period thereafter, the anthem was performed without words, no suitable words having been popular with the people.  After becoming a republic in 1889, it was often suggested among the republican groups in the country that a new anthem should be adopted, as the current anthem was used during the imperial era.  A new anthem was adopted that year, but was not well-recieved by the population, and the anthem of the Empire was declared official on January 20, 1890.  The anthem was still without official words, and each state started adopting their own words to the anthem.  In 1906, it was brought forward that lyrics for the anthem should be written, and in 1909 a poem by Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada was composed.  However it wasn’t until 1922, for the 100th anniversary of independence, that Osório Duque Estrada’s poem was adopted, with several changes to the text.

Brazil, like many other “federalist” nations, have states that have their own anthems as well.

1. Ouviram do Ipiranga às margens plácidas
De um povo heróico o brado retumbante,
E o sol da liberdade, em raios fúlgidos,
Brilhou no céu da Pátria nesse instante, 

Se o penhor dessa igualdade
Conseguimos conquistar com braço forte,
Em teu seio, ó, Liberdade,
Desafia o nosso peito a própria morte! 

Ó Pátria amada, Idolatrada, Salve! Salve! 

Brasil, um sonho intenso, um raio vívido,
De amor e de esperança à terra desce,
Se em teu formoso céu, risonho e límpido,
A imagem do Cruzeiro resplandece. 

Gigante pela própria natureza,
és belo, és forte, impávido colosso,
E o teu futuro espelha essa grandeza,

ao som do mar e à luz do céu profundo,
Fulguras, ó Brasil, florão da América,
Iluminado ao sol do novo mundo! 

Do que a terra mais garrida
Teus risonhos lindos campos tem mais flores,
“Nossos bosques tem mais vida”
“Nossa vida” no teu seio “mais amores” 

Ó Pátria amada, Idolatrada, Salve! Salve! 

Brasil, de amor eterno seja símbolo
O lábaro que ostentas estrelado,
E diga o verde-louro dessa flâmula
“Paz no futuro e glória no passado.” 

Mas se ergues da justiça a clava forte,
Verás que um filho teu não foge à luta,
Nem teme, quem te adora, a própria morte,

And the sun of freedom, in bright rays,
Shone at this moment in the homeland’s skies.
As the promise of this equality
Was secured by our strong arms,
In your bosom, O Freedom,
We are ready to die.

O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!
Brazil, a vivid dream, a lively ray
Of love and hope settles on the earth,
As in your beautiful sky, smiling and limpid,
The image of the Southern Cross shines resplendent.
A giant by nature, you are beautiful,
Strong, an intrepid colossus,
And your future mirrors this grandeur.
 
CHORUS:  
O land we adore, among a thousand others
You are the beloved one.
You are the gentle mother of the sons of this land,
Beloved homeland, Brazil!

2. Eternally laid in a splendid cradle,
To the sound of the sea and the light from the depths of the sky,
Brazil, you gleam, fleuron of the Americas,
Illuminated by the sun of the New World.
Your smiling, lovely fields have more flowers
Than the most attractive land elsewhere,
Our forests have more life,
Our life in your bosom more love.

O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!
Brazil, may you have as eternal symbol
The starry banner you display,
And may the green laurel of this pennant speak
Of peace in the future and glory in the past.
But if you raise a strong cudgel in the name of justice,
You will see that a son of yours does not run from a fight,
Nor does one who adores you fear death.
Chorus

March on to glory, your bright banners waving high.
See how the world marks the manner of your bearing!
Pledge to excel through love and unity.
Pressing onward, march together to a common loftier goal;
Steady sunward, though the weather hide the wide and treacherous shoal.
Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahamaland;
Till the road you’ve trod Lead unto your God, March on, Bahamaland!

		<string>“Druk tsendhen” (The Thunder Dragon Kingdom) is how Bhutanese also refer to their country. The music is reminiscent of the native style of music in that region. The composer of the anthem was trained in India, becoming that country’s first bandmaster. After his return to Bhutan, the Indian prime minsiter paid a visit to the country, and the anthem was composed for the occassion, on the request of the Bhutanese king. The original tune was based on the folk song “Thri nyampa med pa pemai thri” (“The Unchanging Lotus Throne”). An interesting note is that the folk song has choreography that goes along with it, making this possibly the only national anthem to be based on a choreographical work.</string>

		<string>Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus kept the anthem it used as a soviet socialist republic since 1955, without the words. (Many SSR’s have used an wordless, or instrumental, version of the SSR hymn very soon after achieving independence.) Replacing the work outright with a new song was considered, and suggestions such as “Магутны Божа!” (“Mahutny Bozha”) [O God Almighty] by Natalla Arsiennieva (which was recommended by the parliamentary education and culture committee in 1995, but was not acted upon) and “Маладая Беларусь” “Maładaja Biełaruś” [Young Belarus] by Janka Kupala (but was never set to music) were put forward, but no change was made.

On July 2, 2002, President Lukashenko set a decree that the Belarus hymn will have lyrics, and ones were adopted in a contest. The lyrics by the contest winner, Uladzimir Karyzna,  were similar to the Belarusian SSR anthem lyrics and were based on Klimkovich’s original lyrics for the soviet republic’s anthem. 

Protestors against Lukashenko’s government use a variety of songs, including the aforementioned hymn “Mahutny Bozha” and the anthem of the last Belarusian state, “Vajacki mars”.

		<string>The anthem was first written in 1963 by a Belize citizen who fought on the side of the British in World War I.  After his return from the war, he was actively involved in local movements that encouraged Belizian identity and towards the removal of racial discrimination in Belize; the anthem may have been written with these sentiments in mind.  The original title was “Land of the Gods” in response to the prevalence of religious observance in the country.  It was adopted upon independence from Great Britain in 1981.  (The British anthem is still retained in Belize as the royal anthem, as the British royal family is retained as Belize’s head of state.)

Presently there has been some debate about the anthem and if it should be replaced.  The ruling party of the day unilaterally adopted the anthem upon independence and the choice of an anthem was not put to the population to decide, although the choice was agreed upon by the people.  Also, there has been issue by womens’ groups in the country with phrases such as “Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty” and to the militaristic imagery in the chorus.

1. O, land of the free by the Carib Sea,
our manhood we pledge to thy liberty!
No tyrants here linger, despots must flee
This tranquil haven of democracy
The blood of our sires which hallows the sod,
Brought freedom from slavery oppression’s rod,
By the might of truth and the grace of God.
No longer shall we be hewers of wood.

CHORUS:
Arise! ye sons of the Baymen’s clan,
put on your armour, clear the land!
Drive back the tyrants, let despots flee-
Land of the Free by the Carib Sea!

2. Nature has blessed thee with wealth untold,
O’er mountains and valleys where praries roll;
Our fathers, the Baymen, valiant and bold
Drove back the invader; this heritage hold
From proud Rio Hondo to old Sarstoon’
Through coral isle, over blue lagoon;
Keep watch with the angels, the stars and moon;
For freedom comes tomorrow’s noon.

		<string>The original French lyrics of “O Canada” were written in 1880 as a patriotic poem by Adolphe-Basile Routhier, a judge; it was set to music by a prominent French-Canadian composer of the time, Calixa Lavallée and was sung for the first time on June 24 of that year at a banquet in the Pavillion des Patineurs in Quebec City. 

When Routhier’s lyrics were first published in Toronto, a doctor named Thomas Bedford Richardson translated the words of the first and fourth verses into English and to fit the melody. Two years later, the first edition of the Canadian version of Collier’s Weekly held a competition to write English lyrics to the song. Mercy E. Powell McCulloch won the competition with her entry. The words were rewritten again and again, but one version gained the most popularity. It was written by Montreal lawyer Robert Stanley Weir, and only slightly differs from the English version used today.  (Note that while Richardson’s lyrics are meant to be a somewhat direct translation of the French lyrics into English, Powell McCulloch’s and Weir’s lyrics (the latter of which are nearly identical to the current lyrics) are completely different in meaning from the original French lyrics.  The lyrics to the right give the official lyrics in both English and French, as well as the official translation of the French lyrics.)

The anthem’s English lyrics were performed for Edward VIII in 1936 and King George VI in 1939 on their visits to Canada, and the Kings saluted the song as if it was the national anthem.  It then started to be used more frequently as an unofficial anthem and in 1967 it was approved by Parliament as the national anthem, and was made official by the National Anthem Act of 1980.  The national anthem officially only consists of one verse in each language, yet the original poems of both Routhier and Weir have four verses.

Since the adoption of the anthem, there has been occassional attempts to once more slightly alter the English lyrics of the national anthem, to change the gender-specificness of the phrase “in all thy sons command”, or to alter the phrase “our home and native land” to reflect the new immigrants of the country, or to remove the reference to God.  To date, however, the lyrics remain unchanged.

Before the official adoption of “O Canada” in 1980, the official national anthem of Canada was “God Save the Queen”, yet “O Canada” was used on an unofficial basis, as well as the patriotic song “The Maple Leaf Forever”.  “God Save the Queen” remains the royal anthem of Canada.

There are also other patriotic songs (including “The Maple Leaf Forever,” mentioned above) for Canada and her provinces and regions as well as the nation as a whole, you can find a list at the website of Canadian Heritage (a government agency).

		<string>Congo first adopted its anthem upon independence in 1960. Known as Congo (Kinshasa) at the time of independence, to differentiate it from its neighbour to the west of the same name, the anthem was kept until 1971, when the national symbols were changed and the country’s name was changed to Zaire. A coup in 1997 restored the national symbols, including the name and anthem, back to the symbols adopted upon independence. The author and composer also wrote Zaire‘s anthem.

cahoon startWhen South Kasai seceded during the Congolese civil war in the early 1960s, it used “Debout Congolaise” as its national anthem, as their secession was from the provincial government, not from the Congolese nation.Cahoon end

Oh! Central Africa, cradle of the Bantu!
Take up again your right to respect, to life!
Long subjugated, long scorned by all,
But, from today, breaking tyranny’s hold.
Through work, order and dignity
You reconquer your rights, your unity,
And to take this new step
The voice of our ancestors call us.
 
CHORUS:  
To work! In order and dignity,
in the respect for rights and in unity,
Breaking poverty and tyranny,
Holding high the flag of the Fatherland.

		<string>Like its neighbour to the east of the same name (see Congo, Dem. Rep. of) the Rep. of Congo (sometimes called Congo (Brazzaville), to distinguish the two nations) re-adopted its original anthem in 1991, which was originally adopted upon independence in 1959 and and was used until Dec. 31, 1969. 

It is unclear as to who the composer and lyricist are for this anthem, some sources give the authors as Jacques Tondra and Georges (Levent) Kibanghi, with Jean Royer and Joseph Spadilière as the composers, and some list Kibanghi as the sole lyricist and Tondra as the sole composer.

Une longue nuit s’achève, 
Un grand bonheur a surgi. 
Chantons tous avec ivresse 
Le chant de la liberté. 
 
CHORUS:  
Congolais, debout fièrement partout,
Proclamons l’union de notre nation,
Oublions ce qui nous divise,
soyons plus unis que jamais,
Vivons pour notre devise:

Vivons pour notre devise:
Unité, travail, progrès!
 
2. Des forêts jusqu’à la savanne,
Des savannes jusqu’à la mer,
Un seul peuple, une seule âme,
Un seul coer, ardent et fier,
Luttons tous, tant que nous sommes,
Pour notre vieux pays noir.

Everywhere will be able to say how
Triumph comes through battle,
And in the smallest village
Sing beneath our three colours.

		<string>In the summer of 1841, Alberik Zwyssig received a piece of mail from Leonhard Widmer, a music publisher, journalist and lyricist from Zurich. The mail contained a patriotic poem that Widmer had written and wanted set to music. Zwyssig chose to use a hymn that he had composed to the psalm “Diligam te Domine” (I will love Thee, O Lord) for an ordination service in 1835 when he was music director at the monastery in Wettingen. On November 22, 1841, Zwyssig rehearsed his “Schweizerpsalm” for the first time with four residents of Zug. The song turned out to be very popular in several Swiss cantons, and numerous attempts were made between 1894 and 1953 to have it declared the Swiss national anthem, but they were consistently turned down by the Swiss government for the reason that a national anthem should not be selected by government decree but by popular opinion. 

It was due to the fact that the anthem in use at the time had the same melody as the British anthem, that the Swiss government declared the “Swiss Psalm”, a fully and unmistakably Swiss creation, the provisional Swiss national anthem in 1961, the provisional clause was abandoned in 1975, but without official ratification as the national anthem. A number of other suggestions for a national anthem were made in the years that followed, none of which, however, earned nearly as many votes as the “Swiss Psalm”. Finally, on April 1, 1981, the “Swiss Psalm” was officially declared the Swiss national anthem, “a purely Swiss song, dignified and ceremonial, the kind of national anthem that the majority of our citizens would like to have.”

Switzerland has four official languages, the French, Italian and Romansch versions are official translations of Widmer’s original German lyrics. Some of Switzerland’s cantons (especially those with a recent history of independence outside of Switzerland) have their own anthems, Neuchatel’s cantonal anthem, for example, uses the same melody as the former Swiss anthem, that is “God save the King (Queen)”.

1. Sur nos monts, quand le soleil
Annonce un brillant réveil,
Et prédit d’un plus beau jour Le retour,
Les beautés de la patrie
Parlent à l’âme attendrie;
Au ciel montent plus joyeux
Les accents d’un coeur pieux,
Les accents émus d’un coeur pieux.

2. Lorsqu’un doux rayon du soir 
Joue encore dans le bois noir, 
Le coeur se sent plus heureux près de Dieu 
Loin des vain bruits de la plaine 
L’âme en paix est plus sereine; 
Au ciel montent plus joyeux, 
Au ciel montent plus joyeux, 
Les accents d’un coeur pieux, 
Les accents émus d’un coeur pieux. 

3. Lorsque dans la sombre nuit 
La foudre éclate avec bruit, 
Notre coeur pressent encore le Dieu fort. 
Dans l’orage et la détresse, 
Il est notre forteresse. 
Offrons-Lui de coeurs pieux 
Offrons-Lui de coeurs pieux 
Dieu nous bénira des cieux, 
Dieu nous bénira du hauts des cieux. 

4. Des grand monts vient le secours, 
Suisse! espère en Dieu toujours! 
Garde la foi des aïeux, vis comme eux! 
Sur l’autel de la partrie 
Met tes biens, ton coeurs, ta vie! 
C’est le trésor précieux 
C’est le trésor précieu 
Que Dieu nous bénira des cieux, 
Que Dieu nous bénira du hauts des cieux.

1. When the morning skies grow red 
And o’er their radiance shed, 
Thou, O Lord, appeareth in their light. 
When the Alps glow bright with splendour, 
Pray to God, to Him surrender, 
For you feel and understand, 
For you feel and understand, 
That he dwelleth in this land.

2. In the sunset Thou art nigh

Thou, O loving Father, ever near 
When to Heaven we are departing, 
Joy and bliss Thou’lt be imparting, 
For we feel and understand 
For we feel and understand 
That Thou dwellest in this land. 
That Thou dwellest in this land. 

3. When dark clouds enshroud the hills 
And gray mist the valley fills, 
Yet Thou art not hidden from Thy sons. 
Pierce the gloom in which we cower 
With Thy sunshine’s cleansing power 
Then we’ll feel and understand 
Then we’ll feel and understand 
That God dwelleth in this land. 
That God dwelleth in this land. 

4. Towards us in the wild storm coming,
You yourself give us resistance and stronghold,
You, almighty ruling, rescuing!
During horror and nights of thunderstorms
Let us childlike trust Him!
Yes, we feel and understand;
Yes, we feel and understand
That God dwelleth in this land.
That God dwelleth in this land.

		<string>After the melody of Chile’s original anthem was replaced in 1828, the original text, from 1819, was also in need of replacement to remove the anti-Spanish sentiments from the lyrics.  In 1847, the young poet Eusebio Lillo wrote a new text to Carnicer’s melody, however he kept the chorus from the original anthem. Today, the chorus and fifth verse of Lillo’s poem make up the official national anthem of Chile.

Following the coup d’etat by Augusto Pinochet in 1973, the military junta dictated that two verses would be used along with the chorus: the fifth verse was retained, and the third verse, which extolled Chile’s army, was then added as the second official verse. It was a common act of protest by detractors to remain silent during the second verse. When democracy was restored in 1990, the government removed the military verse and restored the anthem as it was before the coup; today, supporters of the past military government still sing the third verse.

		<string>The anthem of this central African French-English bilingual country was written in 1928, and was used as an unofficial anthem in 1948. Official use came in 1957, when Cameroon became an autonomous republic within France. Finally, the lyrics were changed slightly in 1978, to the current version.

Like Canada (another French-English bilingual country), the English and French lyrics are slightly different, on the right is provided the lyrics in each official language, with an English translation of the French lyrics.

1. O Cameroon, thou cradle of our fathers, 
Holy Shrine where in our midst they now repose, 
Their tears and blood and sweat thy soil did water, 
On thy hills and valleys once their tillage rose. 
Dear Fatherland, thy worth no tongue can tell! 
How can we ever pay thy due? 
Thy welfare we will win in toil and love and peace, 
Will be to thy name ever true!

2. From Shari, from where the Mungo meanders 
From along the banks of lowly Boumba Stream, 
Muster thy sons in union close around thee, 
Mighty as the Buea Mountain be their team; 
Instil in them the love of gentle ways, 
Regret for errors of the past; 
Foster, for Mother Africa, a loyalty 
That true shall remain to the last.

		<string>China’s anthem, written in 1935, was adopted when the Communists took power in 1949. The anthem was also the theme song of the film, “Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm”. The film tells the story of those who went to the front to fight the Japanese invaders in northeast China in the 1930s, when the fate of the nation was hanging in the balance. The “March of the Volunteers” gave voice to the Chinese people’s determination to sacrifice themselves for national liberation, expressing China’s admirable tradition of courage, resolution and unity in fighting foreign aggression. The anthem is almost never known as “义勇军进行曲” (“Yìyǒngjūn Jìnxíngqǔ”) [the March of the Volunteers]. Most people in China just call it the “中国国歌” (“Zhōngguó guógē”) [Chinese National Song], or, more formally, the “中华人民共和国国歌”(“Zhōnghuá rénmín gònghéguó guógē”) [National Song of the People’s Republic of China]. 

During the Cultural Revolution (a period of Chinese history roughly from the mid 1960s to the early or mid 1970s, when Mao Zedong was in power), “The March of the Volunteers” was forbidden to be sung (Tian Han, the writer of the lyrics, was also imprisoned), and the song “The East Is Red” (a song that mentions the Communist party and Mao, neither of which are in “The March of the Volunteers”) was the de facto anthem. In 1978, after Mao’s death, “The March of the Volunteers” was restored as the anthem, but with different words, which mention Mao and the Party. The original lyrics were restored in 1982.

		<string>In 1887, a Bogota comedian named José Domingo Torres, combined his two passions of theatrical music and his love for his country to push for the creation of a national anthem for Colombia. He decided to use as the lyrics of the anthem an inspiration poem written by then President Rafael Núñez commemorating the city of Cartagena, and asked his friend Oreste Sindici, an Italian opera teacher, to compose the music. (One common characteristic of Latin American epic anthems such as Colombia’s is that the music often resembles Italian operas.) The anthem was first performed in November of that year in a music hall in the public school where Sindici taught. The anthem was officially adopted by Congress in 1920, and an official transcription was made in 1946. The anthem is always performed starting with the chorus, then a verse, then the chorus, any one of the eleven verses can be used.</string>

CHORUS:
¡Oh gloria inmarcesible! 
¡Oh júbilo inmortal! 
¡En surcos de dolores 
El bien germina ya 
El bien germina ya. 
¡Oh gloria inmarcesible! 
¡Oh júbilo inmortal! 
¡En surcos de dolores 
El bien germina ya. 
 
1. Cesó la horrible noche  
La libertad sublime  
Derrama las auroras  
De su invencible luz.  
La humanidad entera,  
Que entre cadenas gime,  
Comprende las palabras  
Del que murió en la cruz 

Chorus

2. “Independencia” grita
El mundo americano:
Se baña en sangre de héroes
La tierra de Colón.
Pero este gran principio: 
“El rey no es soberano”
Resuena, Y los que sufren
Bendicen su pasión. 

Chorus

3. Del Orinoco el cauce
Se colma de despojos,
De sangre y llanto un río 
Se mira allí correr.
En Bárbula no saben
Las almas ni los ojos
Si admiración o espanto
Sentir o padecer. 

Chorus

4. A orillas del Caribe
Hambriento un pueblo lucha 
Horrores prefiriendo
A pérfida salud.
iexcl;Oh, sí! de Cartagena
La abnegación es mucha,
Y escombros de la muerte
desprecian su virtud.  

Chorus

5. De Boyacá en los campos
El genio de la gloria
Con cada espiga un héroe
invicto coronó.
Soldados sin coraza
Ganaron la victoria;
Su varonil aliento
De escudo les sirvió. 

Chorus

6. Bolívar cruza el Ande
Que riega dos océanos
Espadas cual centellas
Fulguran en Junín.
Centauros indomables
Descienden a los llanos
Y empieza a presentirse
De la epopeya el fin. 

Chorus

7. La trompa victoriosa
Que en Ayacucho truena
En cada triunfo crece
Su formidable son.
En su expansivo empuje
La libertad se estrena,
Del cielo Americano
Formando un pabellón. 

Chorus

8. La Virgen sus cabellos
Arranca en agonía
Y de su amor viuda
Los cuelga del ciprés.
Lamenta su esperanza
Que cubre losa fría;
Pero glorioso orgullo
circunda su alba tez. 

Chorus

9. La Patria así se forma
Termópilas brotando;
Constelación de cíclopes 
Su noche iluminó;
La flor estremecida
Mortal el viento hallando
Debajo los laureles
Seguridad buscó 

Chorus

10. Mas no es completa gloria 
Vencer en la batalla,
Que al brazo que combate 
Lo anima la verdad.
La independencia sola
El gran clamor no acalla:
Si el sol alumbra a todos
Justicia es libertad. 

Chorus

11. Del hombre los derechos
Nariño predicando,
El alma de la lucha
Profético enseñó.
Ricaurte en San Mateo
En átomos volando
“Deber antes que vida”,
Con llamas escribió.

CHORUS:
O unfading glory!
O immortal joy!
In furrows of pain
goodness germinates now 
goodness germinates now. 
O unfading glory!
O immortal joy!
In furrows of pain
goodness germinates now.
 
1. The horrible night has ceased,
the sublime liberty
spills the auroras
of its invincible light.
All humanity,
moans within its chains,
understands the words
of He who died on the Cross.

Chorus

2. “Independence!” cries
the American world;
soaked in blood of heroes
the land of Columbus.
Still, one great principle,
“The king is not sovereign”,
resounds, and those who suffer
bless their passion.

Chorus

3. The Orinoco’s bed
fills with the remains,
of blood and tears a river
is there seen flowing.
In Bárbula they don’t know
the souls nor the eyes,
if admiration or horror
feel or suffer.

Chorus

4. On the shores of the Caribbean,
famished, the people fight,
horrors preferring
to treacherous health.
O, aye! for Cartagena
the abnegation is much,
and the shambles of death
its courage despises.

Chorus

5. From Boyacá in the fields,
the genius of glory,
for every ear a hero
undefeated crowned.
Soldiers without breastplate
won victory;
their virile breath
as shield served.

Chorus

6. Bolivar crosses the Andes
that two oceans bathe,
swords as sparks
shine in Junín.
Untameable centaurs
descend to the plains,
and a prescience begins to be felt,
of the epic the end.

Chorus

7. The victorious trumpet
in Ayacucho thunders,
that in every triumph grows
its formidable sound.
In its expansive thrust
Liberty is worn for the first time,
from the American sky
a pavilion forming.

Chorus

8. The virgin her hairs
pulls out in agony
and from her beloved widowed
hangs them on a cypress.
Regretting her hope
covered by a cold headstone,
but glorious pride
hallows her fair skin.

Chorus

9. Thus the motherland is formed,
Thermopylaes are breaking forth;
constellation of cyclops
its night brightened.
The trembling flower
finding the wind mortal,
underneath the laurels
safety sought.

Chorus

10. But it’s not complete glory
to defeat in battle,
that the arm that fights
is encouraged by truth.
Independence alone
The great clamour doesn’t silence;
if the sun illuminates everyone,
justice is liberty.

Chorus

11. From men the rights
Nariño’s preaching,
the soul of struggle
prophetically taught.
Ricaurte in San Mateo,
in atoms flying,
“Duty before life,”
with flames he wrote.

Chorus

		<string>In 1852, Costa Rica did not have a national anthem. However, when the United States and the United Kingdom accredited their diplomatic representatives in Costa Rica, the president wanted to host a welcome ceremony for the missions. A decision was made that a national anthem for Costa Rica should be composed for the occassion, and the president requested Mr. Manuel María Gutiérrez, Director of the Costa Rican National Army Orchestra, to compose the music and it was first performed for the occassion on June 11 of that year.

Several sets of lyrics were used since the melody was created, and in 1900, a contest was held to replace the existing lyrics to the anthem, which was won by José María Zeledón Brenes. Despite having the words and anthem officially composed and in common use, they were not declared as the official national anthem until 1949.</string>

Gives us sweet sustenance and shelter.
Under the limpid blue of your sky,
May peaceful labour ever continue.

		<string>“La Bayamesa” (The Bayamo Song) was first performed in 1868 during the battle of Bayamo in a Cuban uprising against Spain.  The author of the song played a leading part in the battle, and was captured by the Spaniards and executed by a firing squad in 1870; it is said that just before the firing squad executed Figueredo, he shouted one of the lines from the anthem:  “Morir por la Patria es vivir”.

Officially adopted in 1940 albear start(using only the first verse of the much longer, anti-Spanish work)albear end, the anthem was retained even after the communist revolution in 1959.  The anthem is usually performed with a musical introduction, which was composed by Antonio Rodriguez-Ferrer.

		<string>Cyprus is a bi-national community of Greeks and Turks, where Greeks are the majority and the ruling government. When Cyprus was declared independent from Great Britian in 1960, other national symbols such as the flag were enshrined in the new nation’s constitution, but there was no mention of an anthem. Much debates ensued, and neither community could agree on a national anthem; during foreign state visits, different instrumental marches were used. cahoon, per http://www.presidency.gov.cy/presidency/presidency.nsf/prc34_en/prc34_en?opendocumentOn November 16, 1966cahoon end, it was unilaterally decided by the Greek members of government (the Turkish members had already boycotted the government by this point) that the Greek anthem would be used by Cyprus as well. (The Turkish community does not recognize this and instead uses the Turkish anthem for their self-proclaimed nation.)

In 2004, as a requirement of joining the European Union, a peace plan was proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, which included different national symbols, to make them more inclusive of both communities. This also included a wordless anthem that was agreed to by both Turkish and Greek members of the national symbols committee. However, the plan was rejected by the voters and the Greek “Ode to Freedom” remains the Cypriot national anthem.

		<string>The music to the anthem was composed by F. Škroup, a main Revivalist composer of Czech music and especially Czech opera. The lyrics were taken from the first stanza of the opera “Fidlovačka”, which was written by Tyl and performed in 1834.  The song originally had two verses but when it became the first part of the Czechoslovak state anthem after the country’s liberation in 1918, only one verse was used. Upon dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 1 January 1993, the song became the anthem of the new Czech Republic (sometimes known as Czechia), but only the first verse remains the official anthem.

		<string>The text of the anthem has been written in 1841 by the liberal poet and professor August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, using the melody of the Austrian imperial anthem “Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser” (God save Franz our Emperor), which has been composed by the famous classical composer Joseph Haydn in 1797 and which appears in his “Emperor Quartet”. Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote his text on the small island of Helgoland off the Northwest German coast, which at that time was under British rule. He had been deported from the Kingdom of Hannover because of his liberal ideas, which included the demand to establish Germany as a unified nation. Consequently, the first verse of the “Lied der Deutschen”, beginning with the words “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles” (Germany, Germany above all) was originally meant as an appeal that the idea of a unified Germany should be more important than the many particular principalities which existed at that time.

However, when Germany became a united country in 1871, the “Lied der Deutschen” was ignored officially despite it still being a popular anthem; rather the the former Prussian royal anthem “Heil Dir im Siegerkranz” was used unofficially. Although Germany had been proclaimed a Republic on 9th November 1918 upon its defeat in World War I, it needed nearly four years until the “Deutschlandlied” was declared the new national anthem by the social democratic President Friedrich Ebert on August 11th, 1922, popp startalthough it was used on state occasions in the intervening years.popp end At that time, all three verses were used and was commonly (but unofficially) known by the opening line of the first verse, “Deutschland Über Alles” (Germany Above All).

 The anthem was even retained when the Nazis seized power in 1933, however the first verse of Hoffmann von Fallersleben’s lyrics was misused as a slogan that Germany should rule “above all” other countries, and the anthem was added with the party song of the Nazi party, the Horst Wessel Lied and known collectively as “Lieder der Nation” (Song of the Nation). In 1945, the use of all national symbols of Nazi Germany, including the “Deutschlandlied” was prohibited by the Allies. 

In 1945, Germany was governed by the Allied powers and thus had no official anthem. And when West and East Germany were founded in 1949, initially neither state wished to use the “Deutschlandlied” because of its association with the Nazi government and its misuse of the sentiment in the lyrics.

 After Germany had become reunified on 3rd October 1990, Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker confirmed in a letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, dated 19th August 1991, that the third verse of Hoffmann von Fallersleben’s “Lied der Deutschen” with Joseph Haydn’s melody are the official national anthem of the reunified Germany. (Between the time of reunification in 1990 and the official adoption of the third verse of the “Deutschlandlied”, the West German anthem was in use, which is essentially identical to the current anthem.)  Contrary to popular belief, no stanza is currently forbidden to be sung, however only the third stanza is the official national anthem, sung on official state occasions; other stanzas may be performed for other uses.  (Performance of the first verse, though, is often seen as an extremist, right-wing act.)

The regions of Germany also have their own local anthems, some have been used for centuries, some are new inventions after the war.

With extremes of thirst and pain.

Our flag, whose colours are the everlasting green of the earth,
The blue of the sky, and white, the colour of peace;
And in the centre the red star of blood.

Oh flag of ours, what a glorious sight!

		<string>“Der er et yndigt land” was first performed for a large gathering of Danes in 1844, and became popular quickly with the Danish people. It was adopted later that year by the Danish government as a national anthem, but not the sole national anthem. This anthem is on equal status with “Kong Christian”, which is both the national and royal anthem, however “Derer et yndigt land” is heard more often in the country.  The original work has 12 verses, but only the first, third, fifth, and last verses are used as the national anthem.

When the Danish anthem is usually performed or sung, the first verse is played in its entirety, then it is followed by the last four lines of the last verse. (This is true whether the lyrics are sung or not.)

1. Der er et yndigt land,  
det står med brede bøge  
nær salten østerstrand;  
nær salten østerstrand; 
det bugter sig i bakke, dal,  
det hedder gamle Danmark,  
og det er Frejas Sal  
og det er Frejas Sal 
 
2. Der sad i fordums tid  
de harniskklædte kæmper,  
udhvilede fra strid;  
udhvilede fra strid;  
så drog de frem til fjenders mén  
nu hvile deres bene  
bag højens bautasten  
bag højens bautasten 
 
3. Det land endnu er skønt,  
thi blå sig søen bælter,  
og løvet står så grønt;  
og løvet står så grønt; 
og ædle kvinder, skønne mø’r  
og mænd og raske svende  
bebo de danskes øer  
bebo de danskes øer   
 
4. Hil drot og fædreland!  
Hil hver en danneborger,  
som virker, hvad han kan!  
som virker, hvad han kan! 
Vort gamle Danmark skal bestå,  
så længe bøgen spejler  
sin top i bølgen blå  
sin top i bølgen blå

1. I know a lovely land  
With spreading, shady beeches  
Near Baltic’s salty strand;  
Near Baltic’s salty strand;   
Its hills and valleys gently fall,  
Its ancient name is Denmark,  
And it is Freya’s hall  
And it is Freya’s hall   
 
2. There in the ancient days  
The armoured vikings rested  
Between their bloody frays  
Between their bloody frays  
Then they went forth the foe to face,  
Now found in stone-set barrows,  
Their final resting place  
Their final resting place   
 
3. This land is still as fair,  
The sea is blue around it,  
And peace is cherished there.  
And peace is cherished there.  
Strong men and noble women still  
Uphold their country’s honour  
With faithfulness and skill  
With faithfulness and skill   
 
4. Hail King and Fatherland
Hail every Danish person 
For doing what he can
For doing what he can 
The Viking land for Danes is true  
With fields and waving beeches  
By a sea so blue  
By a sea so blue

At thy gifts so rich and rare.

Healthy land, so like all fountains,
Giving cheer that warms the soul.

Pastures green and flowers of beauty
Filling all with pure delight,
And a people strong and healthy,
Full of godly, rev’rent fear.
May we ever seek to praise Thee
For these gifts so rich and rare.

3. Come ye forward, sons and daughters
Of this gem beyond compare.
Strive for honour, sons and daughters,
Do the right, be firm, be fair.
Toil with hearts and hands and voices.
We must prosper! Sound the call,
In which ev’ryone rejoices,
“All for Each and Each for All.”

		<string>José Reyés was inspired to make this anthem after noticing a published copy of the Argentine anthem. Reyés believed that his country should also have an anthem, so he invited his friend Emilio Prud’homme to write the lines while he composed the music. Soon after Reyés managed to get his anthem published as well; the first performance was on August 17, 1883, it was well-received by the public and soon grew in popularity.

A motion in the National Congress was made on June 7, 1897 by deputy Rafael Garcia Martinez to give the song official status, but the president refused to sign the bill into law, possibly because of Prud’homme’s disagreement with President Heureaux’s dictatorial government. It wasn’t until 1934, many years after Heureaux’s death, that President Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina officially adopted the song as the national anthem.

The anthem never refers to the nation or its people by the name “Dominican”, but rather uses the poetic term “Quisqueyano” throughout.  “Quisqueyano” is a reference to the original native inhabitants’ word for Hispaniola.

This is actually the third anthem used in the Dominican Republic.  The first, used from 1844 independence to 1885, was known as “Canción Dominicana”, and the second, used after that, did not appear to have a title.</string>

1. Quisqueyanos valientes, alcemos  
Nuestro canto con viva emoción,  
Y del mundo a la faz ostentemos  
Nuestro invicto, glorioso pendón.  
 
¡Salve! el pueblo que, intrépido y fuerte.  
A la guerra a morir se lanzó,  
cuando en bélico reto de muerte  
Sus cadenas de esclavo rompió.  
 
2. Ningún pueblo ser libre merece  
Si es esclavo, indolente y servil;  
Si en su pecho la llama no crece  
Que templó el heroísmo viril.  
 
Mas Quisqueya la indómita y brava  
Siempre altiva la frente alzará;  
Que si fuere vil veces esclava  
Otras tantas ser libre sabrá.  
 
3. Que si dolo y ardid la expusieron  
De un intruso señor al desdén,  
¡Las Carreras! ¡Beler!  Campos fueron  
Que cubiertos de gloria se ven.  
 
Que en la cima de heroíco baluarte,  
De los libres el verbo encarnó,  
Donde el genio de Sánchez y Duarte  
A ser libre o morir enseñó.  
 
4. Y si pudo inconsulto caudillo  
De esas glorias el brillo empañar,  
De la guerra se vió en Capotillo  
La bandera de fuego ondear.  
 
Y el incendio que atónito deja  
De Castilla al soberbio león,  
De las playas gloriosas le aleja  
Donde flota el cruzado pendón.  
 
5. Compatriotas, mostremos erguida  
Nuestra frente, orgullosos de hoy más;  
Que Quisqueya será destruida  
Pero sierva de nuevo, jamás.  
 
Que es santuario de amor cada pecho  
De la patria se siente vivir;  
Y es su escudo invencible, el derecho;  
Y es su lema: ser libre o morir.  
 
6. Libertad que aún se yergue serena  
La victoria en su carro triunfal,  
Y el clarín de la guerra aún resuena  
Pregonando su gloria inmortal.  
 
¡Libertad! Que los ecos se agiten  
Mientras llenos de noble ansiedad  
Nuestros campos de gloria repiten  
¡Libertad! ¡Libertad! ¡Libertad!

1. Valients of Quisqueya,
Let us sing with strong feeling
And let us show to the world
Our invincible, glorious banner.
 
Hail, O people who, strong and intrepid,
Launched into war and went to death!
Under a warlike menace of death,
You broke your chains of slavery.
 
2. No country deserves to be free
If it is an indolent and servile slave,
If the call does not grow loud within it,
Tempered by a virile heroism.
 
But the brave and indomitable Quisqueya
Will always hold its head high,
For if it were a thousand times enslaved,
It would a thousand times regain liberty.
 
3. If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit
Unto contempt of a real imposer,
On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were places
Where the traces of glory are found.
 
Where on the top of the heroic bastion,
The word of the libarated became flesh,
Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte
Taught to be free or to die.
 
4. And if an unattended leader the splendor
Of these glorious events could ignore,
One has seen in Capotillo in the war
The flag of fire wave.
 
And the fire that lets the proud lion
Of Castilla become stupefied,
Removes him from the glorious beaches
Where the crossed banner waves.
 
5. Compatriots, let us proudly
Show our face, from today prouder than ever;
Quisqueya may be destroyed
But a slave again, never!
 
It is a sanctuary of love that every character
Of the fatherland feels alive!
And it is his coat of arms, the right;
And it is his device: be free or die.
 
6. Liberty that still rises cool-bloodedly
The victory in her triumphal car.
And the clarion of war re-echoes
Proclaiming his immortal glory.
 
Liberty! That the echo’s touch
While they’re full of noble tension
Our fields of glory repeat
Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!

The poem was put into music, first by Mohamed Triki in 1956, then by the Egyptian composer Mohamed Fawzi and became the national anthem upon independence on July 5th, 1962.

1. We swear by the lightning that destroys,
By the streams of generous blood being shed,
By the bright flags that wave,
Flying proudly on the high djebels,
That we are in revolt, whether to live or to die,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

2. We are soldiers in revolt for truth
And we have fought for our independence.
When we spoke, nobody listened to us,
So we have taken the noise of gunpowder as our rhythm
And the sound of machine guns as our melody,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

3. O France, the time of reproof is over
And we have ended it as a book is ended;
O France, this is the day of reckoning
So prepare to receive from us our answer!
In our revolution is the end of empty talk;
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

4. From our heroes we shall make an army come to being,
From our dead we shall build up a glory,
Our spirits shall ascend to immortality
And on our shoulders we shall raise the Standard.
To the nation’s Liberation Front we have sworn an oath,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

5. The cry of the Fatherland sounds from the battlefields.
Listen to it and answer the call!
Let it be written with the blood of martyrs
And be read to future generations.
Oh, Glory, we have held out our hand to you,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

		<string>Ecuador’s anthem is another example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. The lyrics were written in 1865 (the author, Juan León Mera, later served as president of the Ecuadoran senate) and set to music the following year. Except in formal occassions (where the second verse is performed, followed by the third verse and the the second verse is repeated), the second verse is the verse that’s sung out of the seven verses of the poem (six of which make up the complete lyrics of the anthem.)

CHORUS:
¡Salve, Oh Patria, mil veces! ¡Oh Patria, 
gloria a ti! Ya tu pecho rebosa 
gozo y paz, y tu frente radiosa 
más que el sol contemplamos lucir.

1. Indignados tus hijos del yugo
que te impuso la ibérica audacia,
de la injusta y horrenda desgracia
que pesaba fatal sobre ti,
santa voz a los cielos alzaron,
voz de noble y sin par juramento,
de vengarte del monstruo sangriento,
de romper ese yugo servil.
Chorus
 
2. Los primeros los hijos del suelo
que, soberbio, el Pichincha decora
te aclamaron por siempre señora
y vertieron su sangre por ti.
Dios miró y aceptó el holocausto,
y esa sangre fue germen fecundo
de otros héroes que, atónito el mundo
vio en tu torno a millares surgir.
Chorus
 
3. De esos héroes al brazo de hierro
nada tuvo invencible la tierra,
y del valle a la altísima sierra
se escuchaba el fragor de la lid;
tras la lid la victoria volaba,
libertad tras el triunfo venía,
y al león destrozado se oía
de impotencia y despecho rugir.
Chorus
 
4. Cedió al fin la fiereza española,
y hoy, ¡oh Patria!, tu libre existencia
es la noble y magnífica herencia
que nos dio el heroísmo feliz:
de las manos paternas la hubimos,
nadie intente arrancárnosla ahora,
ni nuestra ira excitar vengadora
quiera, necio o audaz, contra sí.
Chorus
 
5. Nadie, oh Patria, lo intente. Las sombras
de tus héroes gloriosos nos miran,
y el valor y el orgullo que inspiran
son augurios de triunfos por ti.
Venga el hierro y el plomo fulmíneo,
que a la idea de guerra y venganza
se despierta la heroica pujanza
que hizo al fiero español sucumbir.
Chorus
 
6. Y si nuevas cadenas prepara
la injusticia de bárbara suerte,
¡gran Pichincha! prevén tú la muerte
de la Patria y sus hijos al fin;
hunde al punto en tus hondas entrañas
cuanto existe en tu tierra, el tirano
huelle sólo cenizas y en vano
busque rastro de ser junto a ti.

CHORUS:
O homeland, we greet you a thousand times!
Glory be to you, O homeland, glory be to you!
Your breast overflows with joy and peace,
And we see your radiant face shining
More brightly than the sun.
 
2. The worthy sons of the soil
Which Pichincha on high is adorning,
Always acclaimed you as sovereign lady
And shed their blood for you.
God observed and accepted the sacrifice,
And that blood was the prolific seed
Of other heroes whom the world in astonishment saw
Arising in thousands around you.
Chorus
 
3. For these steel armed heroes   
Nothing in the land was invincible   
And from the valley to the high Sierra   
Could the clamour of the struggle be heard;  
After the struggle, victory came flying.   
And freedom followed on victory’s heel.   
And the toppled lion could be heard,   
As it roared in impotence and vanity.

		<string>Estonia’s anthem shares the same melody as the anthem of Finland, with whom they share a similar culture, and was adopted in 1869, several decades before early twentieth century independence (and about 20 years after the anthem was adopted by Finland). 

During the Soviet occupation period, it was illegal to sing “Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm”, however Estonians near enough to Finland to listen to broadcasts from that country were able to listen to the melody of the anthem that way, and thus the anthem stayed in the public consciousness.

There has been discussion about replacing the anthem with an original Estonian work, but generally the two nations have been content to share a melody.

		<string>After the 1979 signing of the peace accord with Israel, Egypt adopted a new, more peace-oriented national anthem.The music was composed by Sayed Darwish, a pioneer of Arabic music and a leader of the modern Egyptian renaissance at the turn of the 20th century. He also maintained close ties with early leaders of the national movement for independence in the Middle East, such as Mustapha Kamel. In fact, the words of the chorus were derived from one of Kamel’s most famous speeches. The music was popular in Egypt, especially after the establishment of the republic, and was long considered an unofficial national anthem until it was officially decreed as such.

The anthem officially consists of three verses, but only the first verse is commonly sung, being both preceded and followed by the chorus.

		</array>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem first appeared in a book of military bugle calls dating from 1761, known as the “Marcha Granadera”. In 1770 King Carlos III declared it as the official “honour march”, and was played at events attended by the royal family. It was then soon known as the “Marcha Real”.  The origin of the melody is in dispute. Researchers have claimed that it originated in parts of Europe outside Spain (such as France and Germany), and indeed the music is not typical of Spanish music.

In 1870, there was a contest held to have a new national anthem, but no winner was declared and the “Marcha Real” (as it is commonly known) remained as Spain’s anthem. After the anthem was replaced by the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War with “Himno Riego“, the victorious monarchist forces restored the “Marcha Real” by a decree from General Franco in July 1942.  Upon the restoration of the monarchy after Franco’s death in 1975, the name of the anthem was changed to simply “Himno Nacional Español”, perhaps to stress that the anthem belonged to the entire nation, rather than just the king. In 1997 the royal family issued a decree regulating the official use of the anthem.  Among other things, a long version (in the sidebar on the right) and a short version (without the section repeats) were decreed, the long version is to be used for the King , the short version is for the Prince, the Prime Minister, or to be performed for sporting events or other events of the like.

There have been many attempts to compose lyrics for the anthem; one set of lyrics by Eduardo Marquina was often heard during the reign of Alphons XIII (1886-1931), and lyrics which were common during Franco’s dictatorship (1939-1975); neither of these were official in their respective time periods, and have not been made official since then, due to their association with the dictatorships of Primo de Rivera and Franco respectively.</string>

		<string>The anthem lyrics were taken from a poem by Johan Ludvig Runeberg, a Swedish-speaking poet, called “Vårt land” (Our Land). The song was first sung in 1848 by a student group and became popular in Scandinavia and many of his patriotic poems, including Vårt land were used by promoters of Finnish nationalism. The poem was translated into Finnish some decades later, after Vårt land was well established as a national song, by Paavo Eemil Kajander and became the anthem before 1917 independence.

Estonia‘s anthem, adopted 20 years later, has the same melody, however the last few lines do not repeat as they do normally in the Finnish anthem.

Interestingly, the anthem has never been officially legislated as the Finnish anthem, but rather is traditionally used as the anthem.  As such, there is no standard way to perform the 11-verse anthem, but usually the first and the last verses (as presented here) are sung.

There sometimes arises a debate in Finland to change the anthem to Jean Sibelius’ song “Finlandia” (the melody was used in Biafra), a song recognized internationally as a symbol of Finland, but the general opinion seems to be for now to keep the current anthem. (One reason may be that Finlandia is harder to sing compared to Maamme.)

		<string>The melody of “God Bless Fiji” was adapted from a hymn by C. Austin Miles entitled “Dwelling in Beulah Land”. The lyrics were then written by Michael Francis Alexander Prescott to the tune and won first prize in a nationwide contest before independence in October 1970.

The Fijian words, while official, are rarely sung, the English version is much more common. The English and Fijian lyrics are also different in meaning, the lyrics on this page give both the official English lyrics and the English translation of the Fijian lyrics, as well as the Fijian lyrics themselves.  The third most common ethnic group on the islands are Indo-Fijians and it was proposed in 2008 that the national anthem be in the three primary languages of the country:  English, Fijian, and Hindi.

Where righteous people reside
Where prosperity and fellowship may persevere
Abandon deeds that are immoral

Be the strength to cleanse our nation
Be wary and not harbour malice
For we must abandon such sentiments forever

		<string>The music for this anthem (also known as “Across All Micronesia”, presumably from a line in the second verse) is adapted from the German patriotic song “Ich hab mich ergeben” (which was also the West German national anthem from 1949-1950), variants of this tune are used in Johannes Brahms’ “Festival Overture” and Gustav Mahler’s Third Symphony). The tune predates both of these, it can be dated to around 1820. The lyrics also somewhat resemble “Ich hab mich ergeben”, which suggests that the writers of the anthem were well aware of the German work. (Micronesia was once a German protectorate, before it was controlled by the Japanese and then the Americans, but it is unclear if this has anything to do with it.)

		<string>“La Marseillaise” was written and composed by Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle, captain in the Engineering corps garrisoned in Strasbourg during the night of 24 to 25 April 1792 at the behest of the city’s mayor, Baron de Dietrich. The song, originally entitled Hymne de Guerre Dédié au Maréchal de Luckner, became known as Chant de Guerre pour l’Armée du Rhin when it was adopted as the marching song of the National Guard of Marseille. The Marseille troops were singing it as they entered Paris on 30 July 1792, and the Parisians dubbed it the Marseillaise. The anthem is probably the first example of the “European march” style of anthem.

During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, “La Marseillaise” was also known as the anthem of the international revolutionary movement. In 1871, it was the anthem of the Paris Commune, and many later anarchists took inspiration from the Commune. After the fall of the Czarist government in Russia, when Communism was just starting to be set up, the melody of “La Marseillaise” was used (with different words) by radical socialists during the era of the Provisional Government, until “The Internationale” gained more popularity, and started to replace “La Marseillaise” as the anthem of leftist revolutionaries.

Under the First Republic, “La Marseillaise” was one of the civic songs that contributed to the success of the Revolution, and thus was given official status (along with “Chœur de la Liberté”, with words by Voltaire). However, it has not been continuously used since the Revolution; both Empires, the Restoration and the Second Republic passed over it in favour of other songs, with links above. During these times, however, “La Marseillaise” still remained quite popular with the people, especially the republicans, these other anthems were created in an attempt to quell the popularity of “La Marseillaise” (especially during the times of the restored monarchy and empire, when a republican government was against the aims of the current governmental type.)

Not until the Third Republic was the Marseillaise restored to its rank of national anthem on all occasions at which military bands were called upon to play an official air.  daniel start   After the fall of the Third Republic and the occupation of northern France by Germany, the Marseillaise remained the official anthem of both the Vichy government (the Nazi puppet state set up in unoccupied southern France) and the Free France forces, who were against the Vichy government and sought its removal.  Both factions also had unofficial anthems in popular use as well, the Vichy government used a song dating from 1847 entitled “Maréchal, nous voilà!” (written and composed by André Montagard and co-composer Charles Courtious), and the Free French “Le Chant des Partisans” composed by Anna Marly (music) and French words by  Maurice Druon and Joseph Kessel daniel end , customarily sung as the anthem. The Marseillaise was made the official national anthem by the constitutions of the Fourth and Fifth Republics (Article 2 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958). In 1974, President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing had it modified in accordance with earlier scores and slowed the tempo. Since 1981 however, the anthem has once again been performed according to the scores and tempo in use until 1974. While there are seven verses of the song, only the first (and sometimes the sixth and seventh) are sung, along with the chorus.

The lyrics, speaking of bloody battles and a call for citizens to take up arms, have been debated endlessly whether to alter the words to suit the more peaceful times that France currently enjoys, but the original words, capturing the spirit of the French revolution, remain. This is probably due to the fact that “La Marseillaise” is now inexorably linked to France in the mind of the world.

The anthem has become one of the most recognized in the world. Tchaikovsky used a piece of it in his “1812 Overture”, which was a chronicle of the war between Russia and France of that year. (The Russian “God Save the Czar” was also used in his work, but, interestingly, neither anthem was used as the national anthem in 1812! They were, however, both used as the respective countries’ national anthems in 1882, which was when the piece was written.) Also, until the adoption of “The Internationale” in Russia around 1918 as the Russian (later Soviet) national anthem, “La Marseillaise” was used by many communist, socialist, and left-leaning groups as an anthem.

Le jour de gloire est arrivé!
Contre nous de la tyrannie,
L’étendard sanglant est levé! 
L’étendard sanglant est levé! 
Entendez-vous dans les campagnes
Mugir ces féroces soldats?
Ils viennent jusque dans nos bras
Egorger nos fils et nos compagnes!

CHORUS:
Aux armes, citoyens!
Formez vos bataillons!
Marchons! marchons!
Qu’un sang impur
Abreuve nos sillons!

2. Que veut cette horde d’esclaves,
De traîtres, de rois conjurés?
Pour qui ces ignobles entraves,
Ces fers dès longtemps préparés? 
Ces fers dès longtemps préparés? 
Français, pour nous, ah! quel outrage!
Quels transports il doit exciter!
C’est nous qu’on ose méditer
De rendre à l’antique esclavage!

Chorus

3. Quoi ! ces cohortes étrangères
Feraient la loi dans nos foyers!
Quoi ! ces phalanges mercenaires
Terrasseraient nos fiers guerriers!

Nos fronts sous le joug se ploieraient!
De vils despotes deviendraient
Les maîtres de nos destinées!

4. Tremblez, tyrans et vous perfides,
L’opprobre de tous les partis,
Tremblez ! vos projets parricides
Vont enfin recevoir leurs prix!

S’ils tombent, nos jeunes héros,
La terre en produit de nouveaux,
Contre vous tout prêts à se battre!

Chorus

5. Français, en guerriers magnanimes,
Portez ou retenez vos coups!
Epargnez ces tristes victimes,
A regret s’armant contre nous.

Mais ces despotes sanguinaires,
Mais ces complices de Bouillé,
Tous ces tigres qui, sans pitié,
Déchirent le sein de leur mère!

Chorus

6. Amour sacré de la Patrie,
Conduis, soutiens nos bras vengeurs!
Liberté, Liberté chérie,
Combats avec tes défenseurs!

Accoure à tes mâles accents!
Que tes ennemis expirants
Voient ton triomphe et notre gloire !

7. Nous entrerons dans la carrière
Quand nos aînés n’y seront plus; 
Nous y trouverons leur poussière
Et la trace de leurs vertus. 
Et la trace de leurs vertus. 
Bien moins jaloux de leur survivre
Que de partager leur cercueil,
Nous aurons le sublime orgueil
De les venger ou de les suivre !

1. Arise children of the fatherland
The day of glory has arrived
Against us tyranny’s
Bloody standard is raised
The bloody standard is raised
Listen to the sound in the fields
The howling of these fearsome soldiers
They are coming into our midst
To cut the throats of your sons and consorts

CHORUS:
To arms citizens
Form you battalions
March, march
Let impure blood
Water our furrows

2. What do they want this horde of slaves
Of traitors and conspiratorial kings?
For whom these vile chains
These long-prepared irons?
These long-prepared irons?
Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrage
What methods must be taken?
It is we they dare plan
To return to the old slavery!

Chorus

3. What! These foreign cohorts!
They would make laws in our courts!
What! These mercenary phalanxes
Would cut down our warrior sons
Cut down our warrior sons
Good Lord! By chained hands
Our brow would yield under the yoke
The vile despots would have themselves be
The masters of destiny

Chorus

4. Tremble, tyrants and traitors
The shame of all good men
Tremble! Your parricidal schemes
Will receive their just reward
Will receive their just reward
Against you we are all soldiers
If they fall, our young heros
France will bear new ones
Ready to join the fight against you

Chorus

5. Frenchmen, as magnanimous warriors
Bear or hold back your blows
Spare these sad victims
Who with regret are taking up arms against us
With regret are taking up arms against us
But not these bloody despots
These accomplices of Bouillé
All these tigers who pitilessly
Are ripping open their mothers’ breasts

Chorus

6. Sacred Love for the Fatherland
Lead and support our avenging arms
Liberty, cherished liberty
Join the struggle with your defenders
Join the struggle with your defenders
Under our flags, let victory
Hasten to you virile force
So that in death your enemies
See your triumph and our glory!

Chorus

7. We shall enter into the pit
When our elders will no longer be there
There we shall find their ashes
And the mark of their virtues
And the mark of their virtues
We are much less jealous of surviving them
Than of sharing their coffins
We shall have the sublime pride
Of avenging or joining them

		<string>“God Save the Queen” (or “God Save the King”, depending on the gender of the ruling monarch) was first publicly performed in London in 1745 to support King George II after he was defeated in a battle in the Jacobean uprising that started that year.  The song was used to boost morale and the forces loyal to George II would go on to defeat the Jacobites the following year. The song came to be referred to as the national anthem from the beginning of the nineteenth century. 

The words and tune are anonymous, and may date back to the seventeenth century. There are various claimants to authorship of both the words and tune, the words can be found as early as 1545, when the watchword at night was “God save the King”, the reply was “Long to reign over us.” The authorship of the melody has been claimed by many, including John Bull (the author of the earliest piece of music that resembles the work), Henry Carey, Henry Purcell, and Joseph Haydn (although he probably borrowed the tune upon hearing it in London.)

There is no authorised version of the National Anthem as the words are a matter of tradition.  The anthem has also never been officially declared as the national anthem of the country, the royal anthem (as this technically is) is used as the national anthem as a matter of tradition, but this is also due to the unique constitutional situation in the United Kingdom, as the nation doesn’t have a formal constitution. The words used are those sung in 1745, substituting ‘Queen’ for ‘King’ (and female pronouns with male ones) where appropriate. On official (and most other) occassions, the first verse only is sung, on a small number of occassions, the third verse is heard as well; very rarely is the second verse heard due to its militaristic nature. There exist many other verses, some dating as far back as the first three verses, but the first three are what can best be represented as the “standard” British national anthem.

The British tune has since become one of the world’s most recognizable anthems, and has has been used in other countries – as European visitors to Britain in the eighteenth century noticed the advantage of a country possessing such a recognised musical symbol – including Germany, Russia, Switzerland, the United States (where use of the tune continued after independence as the patriotic song “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” and one of several unofficial anthems before 1931), and even today by Liechtenstein and as the royal anthem of Norway. The song also was an influence on early anthems used in the Kingdom of Hawaii.  (One might say that because of this fact, that the United Kingdom was the creator of the concept of a “national anthem”.) Some 140 composers, including Beethoven, Haydn and Brahms, have used the tune in their compositions.

“God Save the Queen” also serves as the royal anthem for most Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and Canada. (Governors-general of Commonwealth countries usually have bits and pieces of the national anthem strung together played as their anthem.)

The words of the national motto, “Ever Conscious of God We Aspire, Build and Advance as One People”, appear in the lyrics.  Grenada also still retains the British monarch as their head of state, and thus has the British anthem as their royal anthem.

And one with Africa advance;
Black star of hope and honor
To all who thirst for liberty;
Where the banner of Ghana free flies,
May the way to freedom truly lie;
Arise, arise, O sons of Ghanaland,
And under God march on for evermore!
Arise, arise, O sons of Ghanaland,
And under God march on for evermore!

And join our diverse peoples
To prove man’s brotherhood.

Our promise we renew;
Keep us, great God of nations,
To The Gambia ever true.

		<string>The Greek Anthem is based on the “Hymn to the Freedom”, a large 158 verse poem written by Dionysios Solomos, a distinguished poet from Zakynthos Island. It was inspired by the Greek Revolution of 1821 against the Ottoman Empire. During 1828 Nikolaos Mantzaros composed the music for Solomos’ hymn, one version for the entire poem, and one for just the first two stanzas. Although King Othon (Otto) decorated both of them for their work (1845 and 1849), he did not replace the Royal Anthem of that time with the Solomos/Mantzaros hymn. The royal anthem then in use was a musical derivative from the German one, with a text glorifying Othon and his dynasty. After the overthrow of the dynasty, the new King George I and the Greek establishment decided to look for a clearly Greek work, both with respect to the poetry and the music. The “Hymn to the Freedom” was readily there – extremely popular since the Revolution times, often recited or sung during patriotic meetings and celebrations, and the “Hymn to Freedom” (with Mantzaro’s version for the first two stanzas only) became the national anthem.

The Greek anthem is also used in Cyprus, which has a substantial Greek community.

		<key>info</key>
		<string>Written in response to an 1887 contest calling for a national anthem to be adopted, the winning entry was not proclaimed until 1896, the first ever performance of the anthem took place during a lyric-literary meeting taking place at the Colon Theater, the night of Sunday 14 March 1897, as one of the main events of the Central American Exposition, and the author of the music was decorated with a gold medal and honor diploma. (Ovalle had been known previously for setting to music “Himno Popular” (The People’s Anthem) by the poet Ramón P. Molina. It is unclear whether the music used for Ovalle’s work was the same as the music that was submitted for the national anthem competition.)  The author of the lyrics, however, was submitted anonymously, it was not until 1911, when it was discovered that the author was the Cuban poet Jose Joaquin Palma, who on his deathbed was honored with a silver wreath placed on his head, while outside the public and the bands sang the Himno Nacional.

The original lyrics were modified slightly in 1934 by Professor Jose Maria Bonilla Ruano, a Spanish grammar scholar. Some verses were softened in their bloody context while others were enhanced in their poetic beauty.

The anthem has four verses (including four separate choruses at the end of each verse). Unlike many other nations with multi-verse anthems, all four verses are official and sung in Guatemala.  The anthem is sometimes erroneously called “¡Guatemala Feliz!” (Guatemala, Be Praised) from the opening words of the anthem, but officially there is no title and is simply referred to inside the country as “Himno Nacional”.

1. ¡Guatemala feliz! que tus aras
No profane jamás el verdugo;
Ni haya esclavos que laman el yugo
Ni tiranos que escupan tu faz.
 
Si mañana tu suelo sagrado
Lo amenaza invasión extranjera,
Libre al viento tu hermosa bandera
A vencer o a morir llamará.

CHORUS:
Libre al viento tu hermosa bandera
A vencer o a morir llamará.
Que tu pueblo con ánima fiera
Antes muerto que esclavo será.
 
2. De tus viejas y duras cadenas
Tú forjaste con mano iracunda
El arado que el suelo fecunda
Y la espada que salva el honor.
 
Nuestros padres lucharon un día
Encendidos en patrio ardimiento
Y lograron sin choque sangriento
Colocarte en un trono de amor,

CHORUS: 
Y lograron sin choque sangriento
Colocarte en un trono de amor,
Que de patria, en enérgico acento,
Dieron vida al ideal redentor.
 
3. Es tu enseña pedazo de cielo
En que prende una nube su albura,
Y ay de aquel que con ciega locura,
Sus colores pretenda manchar!
 
Pues tus hijos valientes y altivos,
Que veneran la paz cual presea,
Nunca esquivan la ruda pelea
Si defienden su tierra y su hogar,

CHORUS: 
Nunca esquivan la ruda pelea
Si defienden su tierra y su hogar,
Que es tan sólo el honor su alma idea
Y el altar de la patria su altar.
 
4. Recostada en el ande soberbio,
De dos mares al ruido sonoro,
Bajo el ala de grana y de oro
Te adormeces del bello quetzal.
 
Ave indiana que vive en tu escudo
Paladión que protege tu suelo;
¡Ojalá que remonte su vuelo,
Más que el cóndor y el águila real

CHORUS: 
¡Ojalá que remonte su vuelo,
Más que el cóndor y el águila real
Y en sus alas levante hasta el cielo,
Guatemala, tu nombre inmortal!

1. Fortunate Guatemala! May your altars
Never be profaned by cruel men.
May there never be slaves who submit to their yoke,
Or tyrants who deride you.
If tomorrow your sacred soil
Should be threatened by foreign invasion,
Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,
Will call to you: Conquer or die.

CHORUS:
Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,
Will call to you: Conquer or die;
For your people, with heart and soul,
Would prefer death to slavery.

2. From your old and hard chains  
You forged, with an ire-driven hand,  
The plow that fertilizes the soil  
And the sword that saves honor.  
 
Our fathers fought one day,  
Lit up in patriotic burning  
And they were able, without bloody clash,  
To place you on a throne of love.  

CHORUS:
And they were able, without bloody clash,  
To place you on a throne of love,  
That our Nation, in energetic assent,  
Gave life to the ideal redeemer. 
 
3. Your emblem shows a piece of the sky  
In which a cloud gets its whiteness  
Wretched is he who dares in madness  
stain your colors  
 
Well, your brave and proud sons  
who admire the peace within  
will never avoid the rough battles  
if they are to defend their land and their home.  
 
CHORUS: 
They will never avoid the rough battles  
if they are to defend their land and their home  
that honor is the idea that reigns their souls  
and the altar of the mother country their altar 
 
4. Lying in the magnificent Andes  
with two oceans at hearing distance  
under the wing of seeds and gold  
you become entranced from the beautiful quetzal  
 
Native bird that lives in your seal  
protector that protects your soil  
hopefully he will fly high  
more than the condor and the royal eagle!  
 
CHORUS: 
Hopefully he will fly high  
more than the condor and the royal eagle  
and in his wings, raise up to the sky:  
Guatemala, your immortal name!

		<string>In 1963, a delegation from Portugese Guinea (as it was then known, as a Portugese colony) visited China. After hearing a song composed by Xiao He, one of the independentist politicians in attendance, Amilcar Lopes Cabral, said that he would like that composer to compose a similar song to inspire the people of Portugese Guinea to strive for independence. Using African music as his inspiration, Xiao He composed the music, which became the anthem of Guinea-Bissau upon 1974 independence.

Since Cabral’s organization included both Portugese Guinea and Cabo Verde, the anthem was also adopted by Cabo Verde when their independence was achieved a year later. The two nations even proposed to merge, but this merger dissolved before it was realized, and a few decades later, Cabo Verde subsequently adopted its own anthem.</string>

All sons of one Mother, Guyana the free.

One land of six peoples, united and free.

Our homage, our service, each day that we live;
God guard you, great Mother, and make us to be
More worthy our heritage, land of the free.

		<string>Before the current anthem was adopted in 1915, other patriotic songs were unofficially used in Honduras.  The current anthem is like many others in Latin America in that the music has an operatic, “epic” feel to it (the composer was born in Germany), and has many verses (in this case, seven), which schoolchildren are expected to memorize in its entirety as a way of learning the country’s history, even though the chorus and the last verse are usually only used on official occasions. As such, it can be classified as a “Latin American epic anthem”.

A unique aspect of the Honduran anthem, however, is that it chronicles the history of the country in its seven verses. The first verse describes the country as Christopher Columbus, the first European to land in Honduras, would have seen it. The second tells of how men “from a country where the sun rises” dreamt of Honduras and go out to seek it. Upon arrival, they find that a flag (Spain’s) has been placed there. The third verse chronicles the native population’s attempted resistance against the Spanish. The fourth speaks of the three centuries under Spanish rule, and how requests for change from the colonies, like Honduras, were unheeded; until one day when news of revolution in Europe reached the Americas. Verse 5 continues this thought, stating how the French revolution was a model for those in Honduras seeking redress from Spain. The next verse (verse six) chronicles the revolutions that occurred in the Spanish colonies in America, as one by one they gained liberation from Spain, including Honduras (as part of the Central American federation, at first.) The final verse is a cry to all Hondurans to defend the nation, even in death if necessary.

The chorus, sung after each verse and at the start of the anthem (if all verses are sung), or at the start and end of the anthem, with the last verse sandwiched between them (as is performed at official occassions) is a description of the flag and coat of arms of Honduras.</string>

CHORUS:
Tu bandera, tu bandera
Es un lampo de cielo
Por un bloque, por un bloque
De nieve cruzado;
Y se ven en su fondo sagrado
Cinco estrellas de pálido azul;
En tu emblema que mar rumoroso
Con sus ondas bravías escuda,
De un volcán, de un volcán
Tras la cima desnuda
Hay un astro, hay un astro
De nítida luz.

1. India, virgen y hermosa dormías
De tus mares al canto sonoro,
Cuando echada en tus cuencas de oro
El audaz navegante te halló;
Y al mirar tu belleza extasiado
Al influjo ideal de tu encanto,
La orla azul de tu espléndido manto
Con su beso de amor consagró.

Chorus

2. De un país donde el sol se levanta,
Mas allá del Atlante azulado,
Aquel hombre que te había soñado
Y en tu busca a la mar se lanzó.
Cuando erguiste la pálida frente,
En la viva ansiedad de tu anhelo,
Bajo el dombo gentil de tu cielo
Ya flotaba un extraño pendón.

Chorus

3. Era inutil que el indio tu amado
Se aprestara a la lucha con ira,
Porque envuelto en su sangre Lempira,
En la noche profunda se hundió;
Y de la épica hazaña, en memoria,
La leyenda tan sólo ha guardado
De un sepulcro el lugar ignorado
Y el severo perfil de un peñón.

Chorus

4. Por tres siglos tus hijos oyeron
El mandato imperioso del amo;
Por tres siglos tu inútil reclamo
En la atmosfera azul se perdió;
Pero un día gloria tu oído
Percibió, poderoso y distante,
Que allá lejos, por sobre el Atlante,
Indignado rugía un León.

Chorus

5. Era Francia, la libre, la heroica,
Que en su sueño de siglos dormida
Despertaba iracunda a la vida
Al reclamo viril de Dantón:
Era Francia, que enviaba a la muerte
La cabeza del Rey consagrado,
Y que alzaba soberbia a su lado,
El Altar de la Diosa razón.

Chorus

6. Tú también, ¡oh mi patria!, te alzaste
De tu sueño servil y profundo;
Tú también enseñastes al mundo
Destrozado el infame eslabón.
Y en tu suelo bendito, tras la alta
Cabellera de monte salvaje,
Como un ave de negro plumaje,
La colonia fugaz se perdió

Chorus

7. Por guardar ese emblema divino,
Marcharemos Oh Patria a la muerte,
Generosa será nuestra suerte,
Si morimos pensando en tu amor.
Defendiendo tu santa bandera
Y en tus pliegues gloriosos cubiertos,
Serán muchos, Oh Honduras tus muertos,
Pero todos caerán con honor.

Your flag is a splendour of sky
Crossed with a band of snow;
And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,
Five pale blue stars.
In your emblem, which a rough sea
With its wild waves protects,
Behind the bare summit of a volcano,
A star brightly shines.

Chorus

1. Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping,
Lulled by the resonant song of your seas,
When, set in your golden valleys,
The bold navigator found you;
And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty,
And feeling your enchantment,
He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem
of your splendid mantle.

Chorus

2. From a country where the sun rises,
Beyond the blue Atlantic,
That man who had dreamt you
In search of you he launched to sea.
When you raised your pale forehead,
In the lively anxiousness of your hope,
Under the gentle dome of your sky
Already floated a strange banner.

Chorus

3. It was useless that your beloved Indian
Rushed into the fight with ire,
Because, covered with his blood, Lempira,
In the deep night he sank;
And of the heroic deed, in memory,
The legend alone has kept
A sepulcher in a forgotten place,
And the severe profile of a mountain peak.

Chorus

4. For three centuries your children heard
The imperious mandate of the master;
For three centuries your useless complaint
In the blue atmosphere was lost
But one glorious day your ear
Perceived, powerful and distant,
That there, far away, over the Atlantic,
Indignantly, a lion roared

Chorus

5. It was France, the free, the heroic,
Which in its dreams of centuries slept,
Awoke irate to life
At the virile protest of Danton:
It was France, who sent to the death
The head of the consecrated King,
And which built up proudly at its side,
The altar of the goddess of Reason.

Chorus

6. You also, oh my country!, arose
From your servile deep sleep;
You also showed the world
The infamous shackle destroyed.
And in your blessed soil, behind the tall
Hair of the wild jungle,
Like a bird of black feathers,
The fleeting colony was lost.

Chorus

7. To guard this sacred emblem
We shall march, oh fatherland, to our death;
Our death will be honoured
If we die thinking of your love.
Having defended your holy flag,
And shrouded in its glorious folds,
Many, Honduras, shall die for you,
But shall fall in honour.

Chorus

		<string>The lyrics to the anthem were first printed in Danica (The Morning Star) magazine in 1835, under the title “Hrvatska domovina” (“Croatian Homeland”). The music was composed later (1840s) by Josip Runjanin, a Croatian Serb, on the basis of Donizetti’s “O sole piu ratto” from the opera “Lucia di Lammermoor”. Later, in 1861, the score went through some minor changes done by V. Lichtenegger. In 1891 the song was first sung as the unofficial national anthem at an exhibition held by the Croatian-Slavonian Economic Society in Zagreb. (Croatia, still being part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had that nation’s anthem as its official one.) It remained unofficial until February 29, 1972, when the first amendment to the Croatian Constitution declared it official (despite being part of Yugoslavia at the time) with a slight change in the lyrics upon 1990 independence.

As long as the grave hides his dead,
As long as his living heart beats!

		<string>Kölcsey’s poem, written in 1823, is set in the 17th century when Hungary was torn into three parts: the independent Hungarian principality in Transylvania, the Turkish occupied central Hungary and the remaining Austrian royal (Habsburg) areas in the north and the west. The subtitle of the poem is ‘A magyar nép zivataros századaiból’ meaning approximately ‘From the Stormy Centuries of the Hungarian People’.

The anthem was adopted in 1844, while Hungary was still a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  The title of the Hungarian anthem is often (incorrectly) given as the first line of the anthem,”Isten, áldd meg a magyart”, but the title of the poem (“Himnusz”) is the official title of the anthem.  While the poem has eight verses, it is almost always just the first verse that is performed, yet the entire poem remains the official anthem.

gilmore startAlso widely used in Hungary, but not an official national anthem, is the song “Szózat”, which can be described as the “national song” and is often sung in national celebrations.gilmore end  During the first years of Communist rule, it was debated by the legislators of the time to replace “Himnusz” with “Szózat, as Himnusz is a prayer and Hungary, under Communist rule, was officially atheist, but this was never done.  Instead, it was often performed without the words.

1. Isten, áldd meg a magyart
Jó kedvvel, bőséggel,
Nyújts feléje védő kart,
Ha küzd ellenséggel;
Bal sors akit régen tép,
Hozz rá víg esztendőt,
Megbűnhődte már e nép
A múltat s jövendőt!

2. Őseinket felhozád
Kárpát szent bércére,
Általad nyert szép hazát
Bendegúznak vére.
S merre zúgnak habjai
Tiszának, Dunának,
Árpád hős magzatjai
Felvirágozának.

3. Értünk Kunság mezein
Ért kalászt lengettél,
Tokaj szőlővesszein
Nektárt csepegtettél.
Zászlónk gyakran plántálád
Vad török sáncára,
S nyögte Mátyás bús hadát
Bécsnek büszke vára.

4. Hajh, de bűneink miatt
Gyúlt harag kebledben,
S elsújtád villámidat
Dörgő fellegedben,
Most rabló mongol nyilát
Zúgattad felettünk,
Majd töröktől rabigát
Vállainkra vettünk.

5. Hányszor zengett ajkain
Ozman vad népének
Vert hadunk csonthalmain
Győzedelmi ének!
Hányszor támadt tenfiad
Szép hazám, kebledre,
S lettél magzatod miatt
Magzatod hamvvedre!

6. Bújt az üldözött, s felé
Kard nyúlt barlangjában,
Szerte nézett s nem lelé
Honját e hazában,
Bércre hág és völgybe száll,
Bú s kétség mellette,
Vérözön lábainál,
S lángtenger fölette.

7. Vár állott, most kőhalom,
Kedv s öröm röpkedtek,
Halálhörgés, siralom
Zajlik már helyettek.
S ah, szabadság nem virul
A holtnak véréből,
Kínzó rabság könnye hull
Árvánk hő szeméből!

8. Szánd meg Isten a magyart
Kit vészek hányának,
Nyújts feléje védő kart
Tengerén kínjának.
Bal sors akit régen tép,
Hozz rá víg esztendőt,
Megbűnhődte már e nép
A múltat s jövendőt!

1. O Lord, bless the nation of Hungary
With your grace and bounty
Extend toward it your guarding arm
During strife with its enemies
Long torn by ill fate
Bring upon it a time of relief
This nation has suffered for all sins
Of the past and of the future!
 
2. You brought our ancestors up
Over the Carpathians’ holy peaks
By You was won a beautiful homeland
For Bendegúz’s sons
And wherever flow the rivers of
The Tisza and the Duna
Árpád our hero’s descendants
Will root and bloom.
 
3. For us on the plains of the Kuns
You ripened the wheat
In the grape fields of Tokaj
You dripped sweet nectar
Our flag you often planted
On the wild Turk’s earthworks
And under Mátyás’ grave army whimpered
Vienna’s “proud fort.”
 
4. Hajh, but for our sins
Anger gathered in Your bosom
And You struck with Your lightning
From Your thundering clouds
Now the plundering Mongols’ arrows
You swarmed over us
Then the Turks’ slave yoke
We took upon our shoulders.
 
5. How often came from the mouths
Of Osman’s barbarian nation
Over the corpses of our defeated army
A victory song!
How often did your own son agress
My homeland, upon your breast,
And you became because of your own sons
Your own sons’ funeral urn!
 
6. The fugitive hid, and towards him
The sword reached into his cave
Looking everywhere he could not find
His home in his homeland
Climbs the mountain, descends the valley
Sadness and despair his companions
Sea of blood beneath his feet
Ocean of flame above.
 
7. Castle stood, now a heap of stones
Happiness and joy fluttered,
Groans of death, weeping
Now sound in their place.
And Ah! Freedom does not bloom
From the blood of the dead,
Torturous slavery’s tears fall
From the cold eyes of the orphans!
 
8. Redeem, O Lord, the Hungarians
Who are tossed by waves of danger
Extend toward it your guarding arm
On the sea of its misery
Long torn by ill fate
Bring upon it a time of relief
They who have suffered for all sins
Of the past and of the future!

		<string>The text of Amhrán na bhFiann, consisting of three stanzas and a chorus, was written in 1907. It was first published in the newspaper, Irish Freedom in 1912. The chorus solely was quietly adopted as the National Anthem in 1926, amid much discussion about the national anthem. timothy green and karen c startThe anthem was originally written in English, the later Irish translation by Liam Ó Rinn is much more commonly sung in the country.tim and karen end  A section of the National Anthem (consisting of the first four bars followed by the last five) is also the Presidential Salute. 

There has been some criticism about the anthem due to its militant nature and anti-British tone. karen c startThe words “Fianna Fáil” (Warriors of Ireland) appear in Ó Rinn’s translation, later adopted as the name of an Irish political party, some advocate this be changedkaren c end to “laochra fáil” (heroes of Ireland) instead.  Also, some have argued that the melody is difficult to play, whereas others have pointed out that the whole song has been performed, instead of the chorus (which is the official anthem), or has been played at the wrong speed, both of which have happened at recent Olympic Games.

An anthem composed by Phillip Coulter called “Irelands Call” is used as a non-sectarian anthem, which is used by athletes from both Ireland and Northern Ireland when competing together as a unified team.

		<string>The origins of “Hatikvah” far predate its use as the Israeli national anthem, in use since soon after its founding as the first Jewish state in modern history. The music is based on a folk song of unknown origin, but appears several times in European folk songs and religious music. The arrangement by Shmuel Cohen from 1888 is probably based on a Romanian folk song he heard during his childhood in Romania,  vexler startmost likely “Carul cu boi” (“The Ox Driven Cart”) vexler end. The melody also somewhat resembles  Smetana’s symphonic poem “Ma Vlast”, which in turn was based on a Swedish version of the Romanian song.  The melody is unique in that it is in a minor key, rare among national anthems; however the lyrics (that speak of a “hope”) are of a more uplifting nature.

The lyrics of the anthem were taken from the first verse and chorus from Naftali Herez Imber’s 1878 poem “Tikavatenu” (Our Hope), which had nine stanzas. At the first Zionist congress of 1897, it was adopted as the anthem of Zionism. The lyrics (primarily of the chorus) underwent a few changes between that time and the creation of the Jewish state of Israel some 50 years later, primarily a change where the song once spoke of a hope to return Zion, it now speaks of a hope to live as a free nation there.

There has been criticisms of the anthem both from Jews who feel the anthem is too secular, and from non-Jews who feel the anthem focusses too much on the Jewish population.

As long as deep in the heart,
The soul of a Jew yearns,
And towards the East
An eye looks to Zion,

CHORUS:
Our hope is not yet lost,
The hope of two thousand years,
To be a free people in our land,
The land of Zion and Jerusalem.
To be a free people in our land,
The land of Zion and Jerusalem.

		<string>India’s various ethnic and cultural groups are honoured in the national anthem, and the melody is very reminiscent of Indian music as well. The music and words (including the English translation) were written by Rabindranath Tagore, the same composer of the music and words of the national anthem of Bangladesh.  The poem originally was written (in Bengali) in 1911 with five verses, only the first verse is the national anthem.

The subject of the song is the Universal Spirit that guides India (God), possibly as a unifying link to the varying ethnic groups of the nation. It was first used as a national anthem by the “Free State of India” (Axis-controlled India) from 1943-1945. It was officially adopted as India’s national anthem two days before the republic was declared in 1950. At the time of adoption, another “national song” “Vande Mataram” was popular with the people and many government leaders, but the fact that Vandemataram personified India as a Goddess was offensive to the monothestic Muslim population and led to Jana-gana-mana’s adoption as the national anthem.</string>

		<string>After the ousting of the Saddam Hussein government, “Mawtini” was chosen as a new anthem for Iraq by the U.S. military administrator of the country after hearing it in a concert and admiring the song.  “Mawtini” was sung by the Palestinians in their uprisings against the British mandate and the Jewish immigration to British Palestine in 1936-1939 (the anthem is also an unofficial anthem of Palestine), and continues to be popular with Arabs today, especially as a show of support with Palestine. The author of the lyrics is the Palestinian poet Ibrahim Touqan.

“Mawtini” was meant as a temporary anthem, to be replaced later by an Iraqi government.  Now that an Iraqi government is set up, talks are underway to adopt a more permanent anthem for Iraq.

		<string>Much like the United States anthem, the Icelandic national anthem was originally written for a particular occasion and it probably did not occur to either the poet or the composer that the song was destined to become a national anthem.

In Iceland, nation-wide celebrations were held throughout 1874 to mark the 1000th anniversary of the first Norse settlement of the island. (This is the “Iceland’s thousand years” that are referenced in the anthem.) To mark the occassion, the Bishop of Iceland decreed that church services on August 2 of that year were to be held based on the anniversary, and the text to be presented was Psalm 90. The Rev. Matthías Jochumsson then decided to write a poem based on the Biblical text and the millennial anniversary. While abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland, he met up with Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson, who Jochumsson asked to compose music for his poem.

While popular, it was not considered a national anthem. Icelandic independence was still over 40 years away. At the time that “Ó, Guð vors lands” (O, God of Our Land) was written, Icelanders usually sang “Eldgamla Ísafold” by Bjarni Thorarensen as a national anthem. However, that song had anti-Danish (the colonial power) lyrics and was set to the tune of the British national anthem. Therefore “Ó, Guð vors lands” (O, God of Our Land) was played as the national anthem when soverignity was proclaimed in 1918.   The anthem has three verses, but the first is usually the one sung.

Our life is a feeble and quivering reed;
We perish, deprived of Thy spirit and light
To redeem and uphold in our need.
Inspire us at morn with Thy courage and love,
And lead through the days of our strife!
At evening send peace from Thy heaven above,
And safeguard our nation through life.
Iceland’s thousand years!
Iceland’s thousand years!
O, prosper our people, diminish our tears
And guide, in Thy wisdom, through life!

		<string>Different versions exist as to how of how Goffredo Mameli, a young poet, came to write the anthem in 1847. One reports that Mameli took the anthem to the musician Michele Novaro, a friend, who lived in Turin. Novaro composed the music, and Mameli returned to Genoa where he presented words and music to his friends. Shortly thereafter, “Fratelli D’Italia” (Brothers of Italy, another common name for the anthem) was played for the first time, at a popular assembly. The tune gained popularity throughout the peninsula, in defiance of the Austrian, Bourbon and Papal police.

The other and equally persuasive story goes that one evening in 1847, in the house of the American consul, the center of discussion was the uprisings of the day. Urged by many of the consul’s guests, Mameli improvised a few lines on the spot and later wrote the rest. A few days later a friend took the poem to Turin and read it aloud at a nobleman’s party. The composer Michele Novaro who was a guest at the same party, tried a few notes on the piano and then, went home to compose the song. The anthem was sung for the first time the next day by a group of political exiles in the Caffè della Lega Italiana of Turin.

“Il Canto degli Italiani” (the official title) was chosen on a provisional basis in October, 1946 as the national anthem to replace the royal anthem after becoming a republic, however, it was chosen on a provisional basis.  It wasn’t until nearly 60 years later, in 2005, that it was codified in law.

There are slight differences between Mameli’s original poem and how the anthem is sung today.  The song is usually sung with the first verse repeated twice then the chorus repeated twice.  (If subsequent verses are sung, they are only sung once, this is how the lyrics are presented below).  It is also customary to end with “Sì!” (Yes!), perhaps to match the last note of the song.

There is talk lately of replacing the anthem, firstly because the music is not up to the standards of Italian classical music tradition (ironically, some of Italy’s greatest composers have composed anthems in this tradition, which are used by Central and South American countries, giving birth to the term “Latin American epic anthem”), and also the lyrics refer to specific events that were familiar to the Italians of the time that the anthem was composed, but bear little to no resonance with today’s Italians. However, “Il Canto degli Italiani” is very recognizable in Italy and would be hard to replace.

Downtrodden and derided,

Let one flag, one hope
gather us all.
The hour has struck
for us to join together.
 
3. Let us unite and love one another,
Union and love
Show the people
The way of the Lord.
Let us swear to free
Our native soil;
United under God,
Who can defeat us?

Chorus
 
4. From the Alps  to Sicily,
Legnano is everywhere;
Every man has the heart
and hand of Ferruccio
The children of Italy
Are all called Balilla;
Every trumpet blast
sounds the Vespers.
 
5. Mercenary swords,
they’re feeble reeds.
The Austrian eagle
Has already lost its plumes.
The blood of Italy
and the Polish blood
It drank, along with the Cossack,
But it burned its heart.

		<string>Jamaica’s anthem was adopted upon independence in 1962. The music and lyrics were created separately and then arranged by Mapletoft Poulle and submitted to the National Anthem Committee where it was selected in a competition for a national anthem. (The first word of the second line is often sung as “Guide”, although “Guard” remains official.) 

As a constitutional monarchy with the British royal family as its head of state, the British royal anthem serves as the royal anthem of Jamaica as well.</string>

Guard us with Thy Mighty Hand,
Keep us free from evil powers,
Be our light through countless hours.
To our Leaders, Great Defender,
Grant true wisdom from above.

Stir response to duty’s call, strengthen us the weak to cherish,
Give us vision lest we perish.
Knowledge send us Heavenly Father,
Grant true wisdom from above.

		<string>While in use since the early 1880s as a national anthem on a de facto basis, and the words to the anthem are from the tenth century or earlier, making “Kimigayo” the oldest national anthem in that sense, the government only officially adopted the anthem in 1999. The government presented its interpretation of the meaning of the anthem “Kimigayo” in the Diet during the deliberation of a bill to codify the country’s national flag and anthem. At the plenary session of the House of Representatives of the Diet held on June 29, 1999, Prime Minister Obuchi explained as follows: “Kimi in ‘Kimigayo’, under the current Constitution of Japan, indicates the Emperor, who is the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power; ‘Kimigayo’ as a whole depicts the state of being of our country, which has the Emperor – deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power – as the symbol of itself and of the unity of the people; and it is appropriate to interpret the words of the anthem as praying for the lasting prosperity and peace of our country.”

It is not known who first wrote the words of the anthem. They first appeared in the Kokinshu, a collection “of ancient and modern poems” dating from the tenth century. From very early times, the poem was recited to commemorate auspicious occasions and at banquets celebrating important events. The words were often put to music and were also used in fairy tales and other stories and even appeared in the Edo-period popular fiction known as ukiyo-zoshi and in collections of humorous kyoka (mad verse).

When the Meiji period began in 1868 and Japan made its start as a modern nation, there was not yet anything called a “national anthem.” In 1869 the British military band instructor John William Fenton, who was then working in Yokohama, learned that Japan lacked a national anthem and told the members of Japan’s military band about the British national anthem “God Save the King.” Fenton emphasized the necessity of a national anthem and proposed that he would compose the music if someone would provide the words. The band members requested Artillery Captain Oyama Iwao, who was well versed in Japanese and Chinese history and literature, to select appropriate words for such an anthem. Fenton put his own music to the “Kimigayo” words selected by Oyama, and the first “Kimigayo” anthem was the result. The melody was, however, completely different from the one known today. It was performed, with the accompaniment of brass instruments, during an army parade in 1870, but it was later considered to be lacking in solemnity, and it was agreed that a revision was needed. In 1876, Osamu Yusuke, the director of the Naval Band, submitted to the Navy Ministry a proposal for changing the music, and on the basis of his proposal it was decided that the new melody should reflect the style used in musical chants performed at the imperial court. In July 1880, four persons were named to a committee to revise the music. They were Naval Band director Nakamura Yusuke; Army Band director Yotsumoto Yoshitoyo; the court director of gagaku (Japanese court music) performances, Hayashi Hiromori; and a German instructor under contract with the navy, Franz Eckert. Finally a melody produced by Hiromori Hayashi was selected on the basis of the traditional scale used in gagaku. Eckert made a four-part vocal arrangement, and the new national anthem was first performed in the imperial palace on the Meiji Emperor’s birthday, November 3, 1880. This was the beginning of the “Kimigayo” national anthem we know today.

There has been some opposition lately to the “Kimigayo” both within Japan and in other east Asian countries, for its association with militarism, and for the virtual worship of the emperor in the lyrics.

		<string>Kenya’s was the first anthem in Africa to be written by a group commissioned by the government. One of the goals of the group was to incorporate traditional Kenyan music in the anthem, the resulting anthem, therefore, has a very African feel to it, a typical example of the “Eastern folk” style of anthem. The melody is actually based on a traditional Kenyan folk song, sung by mothers to their children.

Other criteria the group was charged with to create the anthem was that the tune had to be of the right length and quality, yet possesing the necessary dignity. It also had to lend itself to having words written for it, in both English and Swahili (the official languages of the country). The words had to unify the nation, yet contain the aspirations of the whole country. And the melody had to be able to be performed by a military band, without impairing the original feel of the song. With all those goals in mind, the anthem was ready in time for independence in December, 1963.

		<string>The anthem was originally adopted in 1941 and reconfirmed in 1947, around the time of independence from France. In 1970, the monarchy was abolished, thereby replacing the anthem as well. After the communist victory in 1975, former royalist symbols, including “Nokoreach”, were reinstated for a short while until replaced with their own national symbols. phuensaen on fb page per http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/khmer_rouge_flag.htmDuring exile, the second verse of Nokoreach was declared to be the anthem of Cambodiaphuensaen end; after the royalist forces defeated the Vietnamese puppet regime in 1993, putting an end to their long civil war, the royalist anthem (all verses) was also restored to Cambodia. The title of the anthem is derived from the name of an ancient Khmer kingdom.

		<string>Having achieved independence in 1975, a different anthem was used until this anthem was adopted in 1978.  Both anthems mention the four islands in the Comoros, however, only three are internationally recognized as part of the Comoros, France still retains control over Mayotte (known as Maori (or Maoré) in the anthem).</string>

		<string>A year before the establishment of North Korea in 1948, the government of the then Soviet-controlled sector of Korea adopted a new anthem (the one in use at that time was the anthem of South Korea with its former melody of the Scottish tune “Auld Lang Syne”). Unlike most North Korean patriotic songs, the anthem does not mention either the ruling party or the founder of the nation.  The title of the anthem is also the same as South Korea’s (as well as that of the predecessor to the Koreas, the Korean Empire), and the music is somewhat similar to the South Korean one as well.  There has also been a “united Korean anthem” created by blending the melodies of the anthems of North and South Korea seamlessly, used by some to promote Korean re-unification.

There also exists a patriotic song, “Song of General Kim Il Sung” which, while not the official national anthem of the country, is a very popular patriotic song and, unlike the national anthem, does reference the ruling family and founder of the country, and thus is used more in the country as part of the government’s mission to spread information about the founder of North Korea to its citizens.  As such, it is taught in schools and played at public gatherings more frequently than the national anthem is.

		<string>First performed in 1896, it was well-known by all Koreans by 1910. (It was not the national anthem at this time however, as an imperial anthem was in use at the time.) At this time, the song was usually sung to a Scottish folk song, “Auld Lang Syne”, as well as occasionally to other music. In that year, the Japanese invaded Korea, and banned the song. However, it was still popular with Koreans abroad as a yearning for national independence.

In 1935 composer Ahn Eaktay wrote the music that’s currently in use for the anthem (he wanted the song to have a Korean melody and not that of a folk song of a foreign nation). It was adopted by the government in exile and then, when South Korea was founded in 1948, three years after the Japanese occupation ended, it was officially adopted by that government.

The anthem shares a title with that of the anthem of North Korea, as well as that of the Korean Empire, the music is also somewhat reminiscent of that of North Korea’s anthem.  There has also been a “united Korean anthem” created by blending the melodies of the two nations’ anthems seamlessly, used by some to promote Korean re-unification.</string>

		<string>Rarely heard within Kuwait itself, Kuwait’s anthem, like Jordan‘s, has a formal full version of the anthem played on formal occasions, and a short version, which is simply the refrain of the full version.  The “national salute” of Kuwait is shorter still, which consists of the first 6 measures of the anthem.

The Lao people of all origins are equal
And will no longer allow imperialists and traitors to harm them.
The entire people will safeguard the independence
And the freedom of the Lao nation.
They are resolved to struggle for victory
In order to lead the nation to prosperity.

Love the land that gave us birth. 
Land of beaches, hills and valleys, 
Fairest isle of all the earth. 
Wheresoever you may roam, 
Love, oh love, our island home. 

2. Gone the days when nations battled
For this Helen of the West. 
Gone the days when strife and discord, 
Dimmed her children’s toil and rest. 
Dawns at last a brighter day, 
Stretches out a glad new way. 

3. May the Good Lord bless our island; 
Guard her sons from woe and harm. 
May our people, live united, 
Strong in soul and strong in arm. 
Justice, truth and charity, 
Our ideals forever be.

		<string>The Liechtenstein anthem, “Oben am jungen Rhein”, shares the same tune as the British “God Save the Queen”, despite there not being any ties to Great Britain in Liechtenstein’s history. This fact might be explained by its close ties to neighbouring Switzerland, who has also used the melody as its anthem in its past (as well as nearby Prussia, and later Germany, at the time). The fact that Liechtenstein shares a well-known tune with another nation has led to a few situations of amateur composers approaching Liechtenstein officials with proposals for a new anthem, convinced that one is needed.

The original lyrics were first written and adopted in 1850, and were changed in 1963; the second, third, and fourth verses were removed, and the remaining lyrics were slightly altered to remove references to Germany (written to denote Liechtenstein’s membership in the German confederacy (Holy Roman Empire)).

		<string>After independence was granted to Sri Lanka (at the time known as Ceylon) in 1948, the need for a national anthem arose. As a result of a contest, Ananda Samarkone’s contribution, written in Sinhala, was chosen as the new anthem. It was first performed on the fourth anniversary of independence in early 1952.  There was some controversy with the early lyrics, and they were slightly changed in the early 1960s, against the author’s wishes.

The anthem is usually performed in Sinhala, but lyrics also exist in Tamil, the country’s other official language, and are usually performed in Tamil speaking areas of the country.  Despite a government official openly opining that the Tamil lyrics should be scrapped, a public backlash forced a reversal on this position, and the Tamil lyrics remain official.</string>

		<string>Both the melody and the lyrics of this anthem come from European sources (in the case of the melody, not even composed to be the anthem of Lesotho). As such, there is debate in the country about the anthem, not only because the melody and lyrics were by foreigners, but also because the lyrics do not fit the melody perfectly. However, the anthem has been kept since it was first adopted.

The melody was from a Swiss songbook from around 1823. The composer was Ferdinand-Samuel Naegeli (later known as Ferdinand-Samuel Laur). The song that was later used as the Lesothan anthem was titled “Freiheit” (Freedom). Despite being from a Swiss songbook, the musical style is similar to that of anthems of other nations in the area in the “Eastern folk” style, perhaps indicating the melody was “Africanized” sometime after it was first introduced to the country.

The lyrics were by a French missionary to the area named François Coillard. Coillard grew up near the French-Swiss border, close to the area where Laur’s songbook was released, so Coillard may have known of the melody from there. The anthem first appeared in a Lesothan collection of songs for high schools in 1869.

The anthem originally had five verses, but by the 20th century, only the first and last verses were used, the middle verses, written to abolish traditional customs and religions, were deemed inappropriate. 

The anthem was adopted in 1967 by a royal decree, which was backdated to Independence Day, October 4, 1966.</string>

		<string>Poet Vincas Kudirka, also a Lithuanian patriot, wrote a 50-word poem on his views of the Lithuanian nation while it was still part of Czarist Russia.  Written in 1898, he also wrote the music after the poem was written shortly before his death the following year.

The song was first performed shortly before his death for a group of Lithuanians in St. Petersburg and was first performed in Lithuania itself in 1905 and was declared as the national anthem upon declaration of independence from Russia in 1918 and remained so until Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.

During the period of Soviet occupation, “Tautiška giesmė” was forbidden to be sung and a new anthem was written for the republic within the Soviet Union.  As early as 1988, when democratic reforms were being implemented in the USSR, “Tautiška giesmė” was being suggested as a replacement anthem for the Lithuanian SSR.  In 1990, Lithuania was the first Soviet Republic to declare independence from the USSR and “Tautiška giesmė” was again made the anthem of an independent Lithuania.</string>

		<string>“Ons Heemecht” was written in 1859 and set to music in 1864. The first performance of the song was on June 5 of that year in Ettelbruck, where the Alzette and Sauer (two rivers mentioned in the opening of the song) meet. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1895, and proclaimed a “national emblem” on June 17, 1993. (The anthem was recently officially named “Ons Heemecht” over the old spelling “Ons Hémécht”.) The official lyrics are verses 1 and 4 of the original work.</string>

1. Wou d’Uelzecht durech d’Wisen zéit,

Wou d’Rief laanscht d’Musel dofteg bléit,
den Himmel Wäin ons mécht –
dat ass onst Land, fir dat mir géif
hei nidden alles won.
Onst Heemechtsland, dat mir sou déif
an onsen Hierzer dron.
Onst Heemechtsland, dat mir sou déif
an onsen Hierzer dron.
 
2. O Du do uewen, deem seng Hand
duerch d’Welt d’Natioune leet,
behitt Du d’Lëtzebuerger Land
vru friemem Joch a Leed!
Du hues ons all als Kanner schonn
de fräie Geescht jo ginn.
Looss virublénken d’Fräiheetssonn,

1. Where the Alzette flows through the meadows,
The Sura breaks through the crags.
Where the vine fragrant grows along the Moselle,
The sky promises us wine:
There lies the land for which we willingly
Dare everything down here.
Our homeland which we so deeply
Carry in our hearts.
Our homeland which we so deeply
Carry in our hearts.

2. O Thou above, Whose powerful hand
Leads the nations through the world,
Protect the Luxembourg land
From foreign yoke and threat.
As children Thou already instilled in us all
The spirit of freedom.
Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,
Shine for evermore.
Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,
Shine for evermore.

		<string>“Dievs, svētī Latviju!” was originally written while Latvia was still a part of Russia. (This was the first song ever written to include the word “Latvia” in the lyrics). The composition of the song was a direct act of defiance against the Russians, who did not encourage national sentiments. Because of the Russians forbidding the use of the word “Latvia” in the song, it was replaced with the word “Baltics”.

The song was first performed publicly in 1873 at a singing festival, and first performed as a national anthem upon Latvian independence in 1918. It was officially confirmed as the anthem in 1920.

During the time that Latvia was part of the Soviet Union, the song was again forbidden, but upon leaving the U. S. S. R. in 1990, the anthem was again restored as the national anthem of Latvia.</string>

		<string>Becoming an independent kingdom in late 1951, a competition was held the following year for a national anthem.  The winning entry, “Libya, Libya, Libya”, was first performed at the wedding of King Idris in 1955. The composer of the music also wrote the music for the anthems of Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.  The anthem was used until the monarchy was abolished in a coup by Moammar Qadaffi in 1969, when it was replaced with a new anthem.

During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the rebel forces against Qadafi’s government used the former anthem from the monarchy period as the Libyan national anthem in the areas that they control.  Upon the effective loss of power of the Qadaffi regime, “Libya, Libya, Libya” was restored as the national anthem, with the third verse that mentions the king not being used (it is still sometimes heard, or sometimes it is altered to mention other famous Libyan patriots).  (The fourth verse of the original is now the third verse).

Upon independence in 1956, the anthem was confirmed, but the lyrics were not. A new set of lyrics was written in 1970.

Filling each heart,
Sung by each tongue,
Your champion has risen
And answered your call.

The victory they have conquered.
In my mouth and in my blood
Your breezes have stirred both light and fire.
Up! my brethren,
Strive for the highest.

That we are here ready.
We salute as our emblem
God, Homeland, and King.

		<string>Monaco’s first anthem dates from 1841. The first set of lyrics were used as a marching song for the Guarde Nationale, in which the author, Theophile Bellandro, was a captain. The music by Charles Albrecht along with the lyrics were officially adopted in 1867. In 1931 new lyrics were written in Monegasque, the native language of Monaco. The official lyrics are just one verse, and are not often sung, except at official occassions (the instrumental versions are heard more often). Also, despite French being more prevalently spoken in the principality, and French words exist for the anthem (under the title “Hymne Monégasque”), only the Monegasque lyrics are official.

Its new anthem was adopted in 1994. Originally a 12 verse poem, only stanzas 1, 2, 5, 9, and 12 make up the present-day anthem.</string>

Hiding starlight bright and shining.

Wept and sung perpetually
In the homesteads of our folks.

		<string>The music of the national anthem was composed by Norbert Raharisoa, a music teacher and professor. The words were written by Pasteur Rahajason, a priest. It was first performed in the public when Madagascar was declared an autonomous republic within the Union Française. The parliament officially adopted the anthem on April 27,1959. Therefore Madagascar already had a national anthem when it achieved full independence on 26th June 1960.

		<string>The music of Mali’s anthem, adopted two years after independence, is based on an old folk tune, possibly dating from the Mali Empire of the 13th century.  The anthem is in the European march style of anthem, fitting as it is a former French colony, France being the originator and most famous example of that anthem style.  Despite the title commonly being given as the first line of either the chorus or the first verse, the anthem’s official title is “Le Mali”.</string>

		<string>In 1930, Saya Tin was a member of the “Dobama Asiayone” (“We Burmans”) group that was a Burmese nationalist group against the controlling British government.  He composed the song “Kaba Ma Kyei” as the party song and first performed it on July 20, 1930.  Tin was promptly arrested for inciting rebellion and was jailed until 1946.  Meanwhile, the song became a national symbol during British rule and then the Japanese occupation.

In 1947, before independence, a committee was formed to select proposals for the future flag, coat of arms and national anthem. Saya Tin became a member of this committee in July 1947. It was decided to adopt Tin’s composition with some slight changes of the text. On 22nd September 1947, another correction of the text was done and this version became official upon independence in 1948. (A slight change was also made to the words, presumably in 1988, when the name of the country was changed to Myanmar).

Two versions of the anthem exist, a short one when played internationally, and a longer one that adds a more Burmese type of music to the beginning of the piece that is performed domestically.  There is also an interesting custom associated with the national anthem, and that is that singers who sing the anthem must give a small bow upon the conclusion of their singing, as a sign of respect for the anthem and the nation.

		<string>Mongolia’s current anthem has been in place since 1950, yet has undergone several changes in its lyrics. The original lyrics were replaced in 1961, perhaps partly due to the mention of Stalin in the original lyrics, as the Communist world underwent a process of “de-Stalinization” after his death in 1953; it has been reported that between the time of his death and the replacement of the lyrics in 1961, the second verse was not performed.

After the transition to democracy from Communism in 1990, the original lyrics from 1950-1961 were restored, but with slight changes, removing the references of Communist heroes. In July, 2006, the lyrics were slightly revised again, and both verses now have their own unique refrain.</string>

		<string>One of the more unique anthems of the world, Mauritania’s anthem is based on a late eighteenth-century poem by Baba Ould Cheikh, who was inspired to write due to the problem of the myriad of Arabian sects that were developing at the time.

The first president of the country, shortly before independence from France, asked the director of the orchestra of the French broadcasting service, Tolia Nikiprovetzki, to select a melody to be used for the future anthem. This melody, known for many centuries and was the melody that originally belonged to the verses, was selected from the many selections of folk music that were considered.

The peculiar rhythym of the anthem (known as “fatchou”) makes it very difficult to sing, thus the anthem is often (but erroneously) listed as wordless.

Be a helper for God, and censure what is forbidden,
And turn with the law which, which He wants you to follow,
Hold no one to be useful or harmful, except for Him,
And walk the path of the chosen one, and die while you are on it!
For what was sufficient for the first of us, is sufficient for the last one, too.
And leave those people who do evil things with respect to God.
They misrepresented him by making him similar, and made all kinds of excuses.
They made bold claims, and blackened notebooks.
They let the nomads and the sedentary people, both make bitter experiences,
And the great sins of their [doctrinal] innovations bequeathed small.
And just in case a disputant, calls you to dispute about their claims,
Do not, then, dispute on them, except by way of an external dispute.

		<string>First performed February 3, 1923, “L-Innu Malti” became the national anthem in 1945. The author of the anthem’s lyrics, Dun Karm Psaila, (Malta’s national poet), was originally comissioned to write a school hymn to already-existing music, written the year before. He thought of the idea of a national anthem in the form of a prayer, to bind together the political parties and the country with the commonality of prayer.

		<string>Until the late 1940s the state anthem of the Maldives was a melody with no lyrics. It was called the Salaamathi and was performed by the royal band on state occasions at the Etherekoilu, the official residence of the King. 

In 1948 it was determined that the Salaamathi needed replacement with lyrics to accompany a new melody. The words were composed by a young poet and later a chief justice, Mohamed Jameel Didi.

Jameel Didi looked around for a tune to accompany his poem. His uncle, the chief justice Hussain Salahuddine, had just acquired a new clock that played a tune at the stroke of midday, the Scottish folk song “Auld Lang Syne”, and Jameel decided to use that tune for his poem (slightly modified to fit the words).

Although the Salaamathi survived as the royal anthem until 1964, it did not occur to anyone to adopt it as the national anthem. In 1972, for the first time in history, the Maldives hosted a foreign head of state – Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. The Maldive government of the time deemed it necessary to compose a different tune for the anthem instead. Hastily they commissioned the composition of a new melody. The new melody of the Maldive national anthem was composed by a distinguished Sri Lankan maestro, Pandit Wannakuwattawaduge Don Amaradeva. The original lyrics were used, with some changes to mark the fact that Maldives has been a republic since 1968.

Although as many as seven verses can be found for this anthem, it seems that the most common representation is the first two verses, which is what is presented here.

		<string>After independence from Spain in the early nineteenth century, there were many songs popular with the public that were an attempt to be a national anthem, but none succeeded. Finally, in 1853, President Santa Ana announced a nation-wide contest for the lyrics for a new national anthem. One of the entrants, an accomplished poet named Francicso González Bocanegra, was originally not interested in entering. However, his fiancée was confident in his skills and, under false pretenses, lured him into a room of her parent’s house and locked him inside, refusing to let him out until he wrote an entry for the contest. After four hours, using the pictures in the room of the epics of Mexican history as his inspiration, Bocanegra finally won his freedom by slipping a ten verse poem under the door. His fiancée and her father approved of the submission, and so did the judging committee, his entry won unanimously.

After the contest for the lyrics came the contest for the melody. This contest was won by Jaime Nunó Roca, duran starta Spaniard from the small Catalan Pyrennes town of Sant Joan de les Abadessesduran end, who was conductor of the National Band  He titled his entry “Dios y Libertad” (God and Freedom). The combination of Nunó’s music with González’s lyrics was first presented to the nation at the Independence Day celebrations on September 16, 1854. Shortly after his work was adopted as the national anthem, Nunó Roca left Mexico to spend the rest of his life in Buffalo, New York, United States, and sold the anthem to a music house in that country. When he visited Mexico in 1901, he was given a state reception, a medal, and money. He passed away in 1908, but in 1942, shortly before the national anthem was officially adopted, his remains were flown to Mexico and given a state funeral in the Hall of Heroes, where Francicso González Bocanegra was also buried.

In 1943, the anthem was officially adopted, and at that time it was decreed that the first, fifth, sixth, and tenth verses would comprise the anthem.  When a shorter version of the anthem is required, it is somtimes performed with the chorus, then the first verse, followed by the chorus, followed by the tenth verse, followed by the chorus; a shorter version still just has the chorus, first verse, and the chorus.

CHORUS:
Mexicanos, al grito de guerra  
el acero aprestad y el bridón  
y retiemble en sus centros la tierra  
al sonoro rugir del cañón. 

1. Ciña ¡oh Patria! tus sienes de oliva  
de la paz el arcángel divino  
que en el cielo tu eterno destino  
por el dedo de Dios se escribió.  
 
Mas si osare un extraño enemigo  
profanar con su planta tu suelo  
piensa ¡oh Patria querida! que el cielo  
un soldado en cada hijo te dio.  
 
Chorus
  
5. ¡Guerra, guerra sin tregua al que intente  
de la patria manchar los blasones!  
¡Guerra, guerra! los patrios pendones  
en las olas de sangre empapad.  
 
¡Guerra, guerra! en el monte, en el valle  
los cañones horrísonos truenen,  
y los ecos sonoros resuenen  
con las voces de ¡Unión! ¡Libertad!  
 
Chorus
  
6. Antes, patria, que inermes tus hijos  
bajo el yugo su cuello dobleguen,  
tus campiñas con sangre se rieguen,  
sobre sangre se estampe su pie.  
 
Y tus templos, palacios y torres  
se derrumben con hórrido estruendo  
y sus ruinas existan diciendo:  
de mil héroes la patria aquí fue.  
 
Chorus
  
10. ¡Patria! ¡Patria! tus hijos te juran  
exhalar en tus aras su aliento  
sí el clarín con su bélico acento  
los convoca a lidiar con valor.  
 
¡Para ti las guirnaldas de oliva!  
¡Un recuerdo para ellos de gloria!  
¡Un laurel para ti de victoria!  
¡Un sepulcro para ellos de honor!

CHORUS:
Mexicans, at the cry of war,
Grasp the steel and the bridle,
And let the earth’s core tremble
To the roar of the cannon.

1. O Homeland! may your brow be wreathed with the olive
By the divine archangel of Peace
For in heaven, your eternal destiny
Has been written by the finger of God.
 
But if a foreign enemy should dare
To profane your ground with his step,
Think, o beloved Homeland! that heaven
Gave you a soldier in each son.
 
Chorus
  
5. War, war without truce upon him who means
To sully the blazon of the Homeland;
War, war! Soak our homeland’s flags
In the waves of blood.
 
War, war! In the mountains and the valley,
The dreadful cannons thunder,
And the deafening echoes resound
The cries of Union! Liberty!
 
Chorus
  
6. O Homeland, before your unarmed sons
Bend their necks under the yoke,
Your countrysides will be watered with blood
And in blood will be their footprints.
 
And your temples, palaces, and towers
Will fall with terrible thunder,
And their ruins shall live to say,
“This was the fatherland of a thousand heroes.”
 
Chorus
  
10. Homeland, Homeland! Your sons swear
To breathe out their breath on your altars,
If the clarion with its warlike tone
Calls them to struggle with valour.
 
For you the garlands of olive!
For them a memory of glory!
For you a laurel of victory!
For them a tomb of honour!

		<string>In 1888 the Sultan of Perak was invited by Queen Victoria as a guest. When the Sultan’s aide was asked what the anthem of Perak was, so that it could be played upon his formal arrival, the aide, not wanting to be embarrassed by saying that Perak did not have an anthem, perhaps giving the impression that his country was “backwards”, proceeded to hum a favourite tune of his from the Seychelles, which is believed to have been composed by Pierre Jean Beranger. It was, therefore, from that moment on, the tune for the state anthem of Perak.

After an Indonesian opera performed it in Singapore (at the time, part of Malaysia), the tune became popular throughout all of Malaysia in the 1920s and 1930s as the love song “Terang Bulan” (Moonlight). (“Terang Bulan” is now forbidden to be performed in Malaysia.)

Before independence was scheduled for Malaysia in 1957, each of the (then) eleven states of Malaysia had their own anthem (which they have retained to this day), but there was no unifying anthem for the whole country. When independence was approaching, Tunku Abdul Rahman, then the Chief Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (later Malaysia’s first prime minister), led a committee to select a new anthem. Hundreds were recieved, but none were deemed suitable. Finally, the anthem for the Malaysian state of Perak was considered, and the melody, due to its “traditional flavour” was selected to be the melody for the new anthem.

Once the melody was selected, new lyrics had to be written for it. The panel of judges charged with selecting a new anthem wrote the lyrics, with Tunku Abdul Rahman leading the group.

In 1992, the anthem was rearranged to give it a livelier, march rhythym, which was unpopular with the citizens.  In 2003 the tempo was returned to what it was originally.

There exists a full version of the anthem, as well as a shorter version, both presented here.  The full version is generally used in the presence of the King of Malaysia, the shorter version is used to honour the Queen of Malaysia and lesser officials.

Auprès du grand Niger puissant
Qui rend la nature plus belle,
Soyons fiers et reconnaissants
De notre liberté nouvelle!

Evitons les vaines querelles
Afin d’épargner notre sang,
Et que les glorieux accents
De notre race soit sans tutelle!

S’élève dans un même élan
Jusqu’à ce ciel éblouissant,
Où veille son âme éternelle
Qui fera le pays plus grand!

CHORUS:
Debout! Niger! Debout!
Que notre œuvre féconde
Rajeunisse le coeur de ce vieux continent!
Et que ce chant s’entende
Aux quatre coins du monde
Comme le cri d’un peuple équitable et vaillant!

Debout! Niger! Debout!
Sur le sol et sur l’onde,
Au son des tam-tams
Dans leur rythme grandissant,
Restons unis toujours,
Et que chacun réponde
A ce noble avenir
Qui nous dit: – En avant!

Throughout great powerful Niger
Which makes nature more beautiful,
Let us be proud and grateful
Of our new freedom!

Let us avoid vain quarrels
In order to spare ourselves bloodshed,
and may the glorious voices
Of our race be free of domination!

Let us rise in a single leap
As high as the dazzling sky,
Where stands guard its eternal soul
Which will make the country greater!

CHORUS:
Arise! Niger! Arise!
May our fruitful labors
Rejuvinate the heart of this old continent!
And may the song be heard
In the four corners of the Earth
As the cry of a fair and valliant people!

Arise! Niger! Arise!
On the ground and on the wave,
To the sound of the drums
In their growing rythms
Let us always remain united,
And may each one respond
To this noble future
Which tells us: – Go forward!

1. Arise, O compatriots,

To serve with heart and might
One nation bound in freedom, peace and unity.

Help our Youth the truth to know,
In love and honesty to grow,
And living just and true,
Great lofty heights attain,
To build a nation where peace and justice shall reign.

		<string>The melody of the anthem goes back to the 1700s as a liturgical anthem in Spain. It was brought to Nicaragua shortly before independence in 1821, and was declared as the country’s first official anthem sometime between 1835 and 1837.  The wordless melody was used until 1876, when it was replaced with the song “Soldados, ciudadanos” (Soldiers, Citizens).  (This anthem may have been wordless until 1889). It was replaced yet again in 1893 after General José Santos Zelaya took over the country; the anthem “Hermosa Soberana” (Beautiful Sovereign) was composed by Zelaya’s son-in-law Alejandro Cousin and was written by either Rubén Darío, Santiago Argüello or Manuel Maldonado.  Despite being replaced in 1910 after Zelaya fled the country, the song remains a popular patriotic song in Nicaragua.

After decades of political upheaval, which was reflected in the anthem, it was decided to bring stability back to the country by bringing stability to the anthem, so the first anthem, the piece of liturgical music brought over from Spain nearly 90 years previously, was reinstated as the anthem, but had to be recreated from memory as no written record of the music was found.  Also, emergency lyrics were written by Marco Antonio Ortega under the title “La Patria Amada” (The Beloved Homeland) until a contest could be held for new lyrics.

The first priority was to arrange the old music of the national anthem, and Luis Abraham Delgadillo, a Nicaraguan composer who studied in Milan, was chosen to arrange the anthem.  In 1918, the key of the anthem was changed to G major and it was made to be played by a band more easily; the new arrangement made the anthem also sound more like other “Latin American epic anthems” also in use by neighbouring countries.  A contest was then held for the new lyrics for the anthem.  The requirements were that there be words for both parts of the anthem, the only topic would be peace and work (as a contrast to the political upheavals of recent history) and that the words fit the melody.  The winning lyrics were  adopted by the government in 1939.</string>

		<string>The Dutch national anthem is one of the oldest anthems in existence, the melody was known from before 1572 as a French Huguenot melody titled “Charles”, and the song first appeared in 1626 in a collection of songs assembled by Adriaan Valerius. Philips van Marnix van Sint Aldegonde is widely credited as the author, but as this is very much in dispute, the author is at this point basically unknown. It was not approved as the official national anthem until 1932. 

“Het Wilhelmus” has 15 eight-line verses (the first verse, and sometimes the sixth, is most commonly performed). Based on older songs, the Wilhelmus takes the form of an acrostic on the name of William of Orange, the leader of the Dutch revolt against Philip II of Spain.

The song’s style resembles that of the work of the Rederijkers (“rhetoricians”), sixteenth-century companies of poets. For example, the first letters of the 15 verses spell the name “Willem van Nassov” (in the original orthography, the modern Dutch version has the acrostic spell “Willem van Nazzov”). The text is also thematically symmetrical, in that verses one and 15 resemble on another in meaning, as do verses two and 14, three and 13, etc., until they converge in the eighth verse, the heart of the song: “Oh David, thou soughtest shelter / From King Saul’s tyranny”. The words of the song also highly resemble the poems in the biblical book of Psalms.  (The English versification to the right is meant to preserve not only the rhyming scheme and rhythm so that it can be sung to the melody, but also the symmetry of the verses and the acrostic.)

Another fact about the anthem that is often in dispute is the use of the word “Duitsen” in the second line of the first verse. Often translated as “German”, William’s birthplace indeed lies in modern-day Germany, however, Germany as a nation would not exist for another 300 years (the area still being known as the “Holy Roman Empire”). Only in modern Dutch has “Duits” come to mean “German” in all uses. start marjan Others have interpreted the word to mean “of the people”, which of course makes it more inclusive of the Dutch people.  end marjan This site prefers “Germanic” as the translation; the original lyrics read “van Duytschen bloet”, “Duytschen” referring not to Germany (as it has been established that there was no such nation at the time), but to the lowlands area, which includes the modern-day Netherlands and certain areas of Germany, including where William of Orange was born; the word therefore highlighted William’s local origins. “Germanic” may be the best modern word to cover the original intent and area inferred.

1. Wilhelmus van Nassouwe
Ben ik van Duitsen bloed
Den vaderland getrouwe
Blijf ik tot in den dood
Een Prince van Oranjen
Ben ik vrij onverveerd
Den Koning van Hispanjen 
Heb ik altijd geëerd

2. In Godes vrees te leven
Heb ik altijd betracht
Daarom ben ik verdreven
Om land om luid’ gebracht
Maar God zal mij regeren
Als een goed instrument
Dat ik zal wederkeren
In mijnen regiment

3. Lijdt u mijn onderzaten
Die oprecht zijn van aard
God zal u niet verlaten
Al zijt gij nu bezwaard
Die vroom begeert te leven
Bidt God nacht ende dag
Dat hij mij kracht wil geven
Dat ik u helpen mag

4. Lijf en goed al te samen
Heb ik u niet verschoond
Mijn broeders hoog van namen
Hebben ‘t u ook vertoond
Graaf Adolf is gebleven
In Friesland in den slag
Zijn ziel in ‘t eeuwig leven
Verwacht den jongsten dag

5. Edel en hoog geboren
Van keizerlijken stam 
Een vorst des rijks verkoren
Als een vroom Christenman
Voor Godes woord geprezen
Heb ik vrij onversaagd
Als een held zonder vrezen
Mijn edel bloed gewaagd

6. Mijn schild ende betrouwen
Zijt gij o God mijn Heer
Op u zo wil ik bouwen
Verlaat mij nimmermeer
Dat ik doch vroom mag blijven
Uw dienaar t’aller stond
Die tirannie verdrijven
Die mij mijn hert doorwondt

7. Van al die mij bezwaren
En mijn vervolgers zijn
Mijn God wilt doch bewaren
Den trouwen dienaar dijn
Dat zal mij niet verrassen
In haren bozen moed
Haar handen niet en wassen
In mijn onschuldig bloed

8. Als David moeste vluchten
Voor Saul den tiran
Zo heb ik moeten zuchten
Met menig edelman
Maar God heeft hem verheven
Verlost uit alder nood
Een koninkrijk gegeven
In Israël zeer groot

9. Na ‘t zuur zal ik ontvangen
Van God mijn Heer dat zoet
Daar na zo doet verlangen
Mijn vorstelijk gemoed: 
Dat is dat ik mag sterven
Met eren in dat veld
Een eeuwig rijk verwerven
Als een getrouwe held

10. Niet doet mij meer erbarmen
In mijnen wederspoed
Dan dat men ziet verarmen
Des Konings landen goed
Dat u de Spanjaards krenken
O edel Neerland zoet
Als ik daar aan gedenke
Mijn edel hert dat bloedt

11. Als een Prins opgezeten
Met mijner heires kracht
Van den tiran vermeten
Heb ik den slag verwacht 
Die bij Maastricht begraven
Bevreesde mijn geweld
Mijn ruiters zag men draven
Zeer moedig door dat veld

12. Zo het den wille des Heren
Op die tijd had geweest
Had ik geern willen keren
Van u dit zwaar tempeest
Maar de Heer van hier boven
Die alle ding regeert
Die men altijd moet loven
En heeft het niet begeerd

13. Zeer prinselijk was gedreven
Mijn prinselijk gemoed
Standvastig is gebleven
Mijn hert in tegenspoed 
Den Heer heb ik gebeden
Van mijnes herten grond
Dat hij mijn zaak wil reden
Mijn onschuld doen bekend

14. Oorlof mijn arme schapen 
Die zijt in groten nood
Uw herder zal niet slapen
Al zijt gij nu verstrooid!
Tot God wilt u begeven
Zijn heilzaam woord neemt aan
Als vrome Christen leven
‘t Zal hier naast zijn gedaan

15. Voor God wil ik belijden
En zijner groter macht
Dat ik tot genen tijden
Den Koning heb veracht
Dat dat ik God den Here
Der hoogster Majesteit
Heb moeten obediëren
In der gerechtigheid

1. William of Nassau, scion
Of an old Germanic line, 
I dedicate undying
Faith to this land of mine.
A prince I am, undaunted,
Of Orange, ever free,
To the king of Spain I’ve granted
A lifelong loyalty.
 
2. I’ve ever tried to live in 
The fear of God’s command 
And therefore I’ve been driven 
From people, home, and land, 
But God, I trust, will rate me 
His willing instrument 
And one day reinstate me 
Into my government.
 
3. Let no despair betray you, 
My subjects true and good. 
The Lord will surely stay you
Though now you are pursued. 
He who would live devoutly
Must pray God day and night
To throw His power about me
As champion of your right.
 
4. Life and my all for others 
I sacrificed, for you! 
And my illustrious brothers 
Proved their devotion too. 
Count Adolf, more’s the pity, 
Fell in the Frisian fray, 
And in the eternal city 
Awaits the judgement day.

5. I, nobly born, descended 
From an imperial stock.
An empire’s prince, defended
(Braving the battle’s shock
Heroically and fearless
As pious Christian ought)
With my life’s blood the peerless
Gospel of God our Lord.
 
6. A shield and my reliance, 
O God, Thou ever wert. 
I’ll trust unto Thy guidance. 
O leave me not ungirt. 
That I may stay a pious.
Servant of Thine for aye
And drive the plagues that try us
And tyranny away.
 
7. My God, I pray thee, save me 
From all who do pursue 
And threaten to enslave me,
Thy trusted servant true.
O Father, do not sanction
Their wicked, foul design,
Don’t let them wash their hands in
This guiltless blood of mine.
 
8. O David, thou soughtest shelter 
From King Saul’s tyranny. 
Even so I fled this welter 
And many a lord with me. 
But God the Lord did save him 
From exile and its hell 
And, in His mercy, gave him
A realm in Israel.
 
9. Fear not ‘t will rain sans ceasing 
The clouds are bound to part. 
I bide that sight so pleasing 
Unto my princely heart,
Which is that I with honour 
Encounter death in war 
And meet in heaven my Donor 
His faithful warrior.
 
10. Nothing so moves my pity 
As seeing through these lands
Field, village, town and city
Pillaged by roving hands.
O that the Spaniards rape thee
My Netherlands so sweet
The thought of that does grip me
Causing my heart to bleed.
 
11. Astride on steed of mettle 
I’ve waited with my host 
The tyrant’s call to battle 
Who durst not do his boast 
For, near Maastricht ensconced, 
He feared the force I wield 
My horsemen saw one bounce it 
Bravely across the field.
 
12. Surely if God had willed it, 
When that fierce tempest blew, 
My power would have stilled it
Or turned its blast from you. 
But He who dwells in heaven, 
Whence all our blessings flow, 
For which aye praise be given, 
Did not desire it so.
 
13. Steadfast my heart remaineth 
In my adversity
My princely courage straineth
All nerves to live and be.
I’ve prayed the Lord my Master
With fervid heart and tense
To save me from disaster
And prove my innocence.
 
14. Alas! my flock. To sever 
Is hard on us. Farewell.
Your Shepherd wakes, wherever
Dispersed you may dwell.
Pray God that He may ease you.
His gospel be your cure.
Walk in the steps of Jesus
This life will not endure.
 
15. Unto the Lord His power 
I do confession make 
That ne’er at any hour 
Ill of the king I spake. 
But unto God, the greatest 
Of Majesties I owe
Obedience first and latest 
For Justice wills it so.

		<string>The words for the national anthem, written by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, one of Norway’s great dramatists and poets, were first published in 1859. The original poem had six verses; in 1863 one of the original verses were deleted and three more were added, giving a total of eight verses; the deleted verse was a tribute to King Carl XV, but Bjørnson changed his political views later from monarchism to republicanism, and deleted that verse.  Nowadays, the first verse and last two verses are most commonly sung.

The music was composed by Rikard Nordraak, cousin of Bjørnson and a friend of the famed Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, in 1864. It was first performed later that year for the 50th anniversary of their constitution, and caught on quickly, overtaking “Sønner af Norges” in popularity. It became a part of the reading books in schools all over the country, and was sung by the children in the children’s parades organized by Bjørnson on every 17th of May.

Despite its widespread use as the national anthem, it has never been officially declared as such. It has been the most popular song presented as the anthem since the early twentieth century, and was performed as the national anthem at the time of Norwegian independence in 1905.  Since the summer of 2011, the patriotic song “Mitt lille land” has also been referred to as a “new national anthem”, and has been performed at patriotic events, but has not been used as a national anthem as much as “Ja, vi esker” continues to be.</string>

as if they were men;
others could only cry

just remember what happened
down at Fredrikshald!

freedom was to us born.
It gave (us) father’s strength to carry
famine and war,
it gave death itself its honour –
and it gave reconciliation.

Driven forth to a stand by shame
we went to the south;
now we three brothers stand united,
and shall stand like that!

The country he wanted to protect,

All the fights fathers have fought,

the Lord has quietly moved
so we won our rights.

And as the fathers’ struggle has raised
it from need to victory,
even we, when it is demanded,
for its peace, its peace will encamp

		<string>After the revolutions of spring 2006 against the monarchy, Nepal sought to replace its pro-monarchy anthem with a new one in a public contest. The winner, Pradeep Kumar Rai (writing under the pen name व्याकुल माइला (Byakul Maila)) was selected from 1,272 submissions. During the submission process, Rai and his family were interviewed several times to prove he was not a monarchist, since he one edited a book of poetry that contained a submission from the king.

The new anthem was officially declared on August 3, 2007.  Despite the lyrics speaking of diversity, peace, and unity, the anthem is seen as highly tied to the Maoist government that controls Nepal, whereas some of the Maoists themselves want a more revolutionary anthem.

			<string>1940 (national hymn)</string>
			<string>1977 (national anthem)</string>
		</array>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>New Zealand holds a unique position in the world in that it officially has two national anthems of equal standing – “God Defend New Zealand” and “God Save The Queen”.  (The lone other example in the world is Denmark, where the royal and national anthems have equal status in the country.)

“God Defend New Zealand” was written by Irish-born poet and New Zealand citizen Thomas Bracken in 1870, and the music composed by John Joseph Woods as a result of a newspaper contest in 1876. (Woods actually composed the music in one sitting, starting as soon as he read about the contest and not resting until he was finished.)  Gaining popularity in the first half of the twentieth century, it was adopted as New Zealand’s national song in 1940 (New Zealand’s centennial year), but “God Save the Queen” remained the sole national anthem. A petition in 1976 prompted the government to seek royal assent to make “God Defend New Zealand” as a national anthem on equal status with “God Save the Queen”. This was signed into law by the Queen on November 21, 1977.

The Māori words, officially translated numerous times, are made to fit the melody. As such, they don’t translate exactly to the English lyrics. A translation of the official Māori lyrics is provided on the right hand side of this page. The anthem is commonly sung lately with the first verse in Māori followed by the first verse in English.

 

God Save the Queen has been New Zealand’s official anthem since 1840, when it became a British colony. The second verse, which is in a more militaristic vein, and the third verse, have been replaced in New Zealand with a “Commonwealth verse“, usually used when more than one stanza is needed. Despite being declared an “official anthem” by the New Zealand government, along with “God Defend New Zealand”, “God Save the Queen” is rarely sung in the country, it is used in the capacity that a royal anthem would be used (that is, when a member of the royal family is present, or their representative, or allegiance to the crown is to be demonstrated by the performance).  As such, “God Defend New Zealand” is much more commonly heard.</string>

En el campo feliz de la unión;
Con ardientes fulgores de gloria
Se ilumina la nueva nación. 

1. Es preciso cubrir con un velo
Del pasado el calvario y la cruz;
Y que adorne el azul de tu cielo
De concordia la espléndida luz. 

El progreso acaricia tus lares.
Al compás de sublime canción,
Ves rugir a tus pies ambos mares
Quedan rumbo a tu noble misión.

A los besos del tibio terral,
Terminaron guerreros fragores;
Sólo reina el amor fraternal. 

Adelante la pica y la pala,
Al trabajo sin más dilación,
Y seremos así prez y gala
De este mundo feraz de Colón.

The Calvary and Cross of the past,
And for you to adorn the azure of your skies
With the splendid light of concord.

Progress fondly touches your homes,
In time with the music of a sublime song.
You see, roaring at your feet, two oceans
Which give direction to your noble mission.

Chorus 

2. On your flower-covered soil,
Kissed by the warm breeze,
Warlike clamour has ended
And only brotherly love reigns.

Ahead, with spade and stone-mason’s hammer!
To work, without more delay!
In this way we shall be the honour and glory
Of this fertile land of Columbus.

		<string>The first leader of Peru declared a contest to compose a new national anthem shortly after independence. The winning anthem, entitled “Marcha Nacional” (National March) was accepted immediately as the new national anthem, and was sung for the first time in  the Principal Theatre of Lima on the night of 24 September 1821. In the intervening years, there were efforts to alter the lyrics (partly due to the anthem’s anti-Spanish tone) but in 1913 the lyrics were declared to be sacrosanct and not to be rewritten (previous efforts to do so didn’t catch on in popularity anyway).  Despite this, the anthem continued to be revised in the ensuing decades.  Different words for the first verse, then the second and third verses, were written, with varying degrees of success, during different presidential regimes but after their terms were over, the lyrics reverted back to the original ones.

In 2005, it was determined that the first verse, which was most commonly sung at the time, was not written by José de la Torre Ugarte, but it had become part of the popular ethos by this time, as well as being part of the 1913 law regarding the intangibleness of the anthem.  It was also determined that the original fifth stanza had been excluded from the anthem, and was reinstated as the sixth stanza, making seven stanzas in all.  In 2009, the government declared the last verse to be the official verse to be sung when the anthem is played.</string>

Somos libres, seámoslo siempre,
y antes niegue sus luces 
sus luces, sus luces el sol
que  faltemos al voto solemne
que la patria al eterno elevó.  
que  faltemos al voto solemne
que la patria al eterno elevó.  
que  faltemos al voto solemne

1. Largo tiempo el peruano oprimido
la ominosa cadena arrastró;
condenado a una cruel servidumbre
largo tiempo, largo tiempo 
largo tiempo en silencio gimió.  
Más apenas el grito sagrado
¡Libertad! en sus costas se oyó,
la indolencia de esclavo sacude,
la humillada , la humillada
la humillada cerviz levantó  
cerviz levantó.  
 
Chorus

2. Y al estruendo de broncas cadenas
que escuchamos tres siglos de horror,
de los libres al grito sagrado
que oyó atónito el mundo, cesó.  
Por doquier San Martín inflamado,
libertad, libertad, pronunció,
y meciendo su base los andes
la anunciaron, también, a una voz.  
 
Chorus

3. Con su influjo los pueblos despiertan
y cual rayo corrió la opinión;
desde el istmo a las tierras del fuego
desde el fuego a la helada región.
Todos juran romper el enlace  
que natura a ambos mundos negó,
y quebrar ese cetro que España,
reclinaba orgulloso en los dos.  
 
Chorus

4. Lima, cumple ese voto solemne,
y, severa, su enojo mostró,
al tirano impotente lanzando
que intentaba alargar su opresión.    
A su esfuerzo saltaron los grillos
y los surcos que en sí reparó,
le atizaron el odio y venganza
que heredara de su Inca y Señor.  
 
Chorus

5. Compatriotas no más, verla esclava
si humillada tres siglos gimió,
para siempre jurémosla libre
manteniendo su propio esplendor.    
Nuestros brazos, hasta hoy desarmados
estén siempre cebando el cañón,
que algún día las playas de Iberia,
sentirán de su estruendo el terror.  
 
Chorus

6. Excitemos los celos de España
pues presiente con mengua y furor
que en concurso de grandes naciones
nuestra patria entrará en parangón.
En la lista que de éstas se forme
llenaremos primero el reglón
que el tirano ambicioso Iberino,
que la América toda asoló.
 
Chorus

7. En su cima los andes sostengan
la bandera o pendón bicolor
que a los siglos anuncie el esfuerzo
que ser libres, por siempre nos dio.
A su sombra vivamos tranquilos,
y al nacer por sus cumbres el sol,
renovemos el gran juramento
que rendimos al Dios de Jacob.

CHORUS:
We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so!
and let the sun rather deny its light
its lights, its lights…the sun!
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal.

1. For a long time the oppressed Peruvian
dragged the ominous chain;
sentenced to a cruel servitude
for a long time, for a long time
for a long time in silence he moaned.
But as soon as the sacred cry
“Liberty!” was heard on its coasts,
he shook off the indolence of slavery,
the humiliated, the humiliated
the humiliated neck he raised
the humiliated neck he raised
the neck he raised!.
 
Chorus

2. Now the roar of rough chains
that we had heard for three centuries of horror
from the free, at the sacred cry
that the world heard astonished, ceased.
Everywhere the inflamed San Martín
“Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced;
and the Andes, rocking their base,
announced it as well, in unison.
 
Chorus

3. With its influx the peoples woke up,
and like lighting ran the opinion;
from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego,
and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region.
Everyone vowed to break the link
that Nature denied to both worlds,
and break the sceptre that Spain
had reclined, proud, on both.
 
Chorus

4. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow,
and, severe, her anger showed
by throwing out the powerless tyrant,
who had been trying to extend his oppression.
On her endeavor the shackles cracked,
and the furrows that she had repaired in herself
stirred up her hatred and vengeance,
inherited from her Inca and Lord.
 
Chorus

5. Countrymen, may we see her a slave no more.
If for three centuries she moaned, humiliated,
forever may we vow that she be free,
maintaining her own splendor.
Our arms, until today unarmed,
be they always readying the cannon,
that some day the beaches of Iberia
will feel the horror of its roar.
 
Chorus

6. May we arouse the jealousy of Spain
since it has a premonition, with want and furor,
that in a contest of great nations
our country will enter in comparison.
On the list formed by these
we shall fill the line first,
ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant,
who devastated all of America.
 
Chorus

7. On its summit may the Andes sustain
the two-color flag or standard,
may it announce to the centuries the effort
that being free gave us forever.
Under its shadow may we live calmly
and, at the sun’s birth over its summits,
may we renew the great oath
we rendered to the God of Jacob. 
 
Chorus

		<string>On June 5, 1898, a week before Philippine independence would be declared, Julian Felipe, a local pianist from Kawit, Cavite, arrived at the home of Maximo Inocencio, one of Cavite’s thirteen martyrs during the revolution. Upon his arrival, the leader of the revolution, General Emilio Aguinaldo, asked Felipe to play a march written by a Filipino in Hong Kong. However, Aguinaldo was not satisfied with this march. Recognizing Felipe’s skills, he asked him to compose a more soul-rousing tune that would install courage and patriotism in the hearts of every Filipino.

On June 11, the day before the declaration of independence, Felipe arrived again and played his tune to the revolutionary leaders. The leaders unanimously approved it as the national hymn. Felipe called his work the “Marcha Filipina Magdalo.” The next day, Felipe’s tune was played during the hoisting of the Philippine flag at the historic window at the Aguinaldo mansion. The march was renamed the “Marcha Nacional Filipina,” and immediately became the National Anthem. However, the anthem still lacked words. The next year, a young soldier named José Palma penned the poem “Filipinas” in Spanish, to match the music of the anthem. It was adopted as the official lyrics.

The Philippines were now under American rule, and as such, a suitable English translation was to be made of the anthem. The first translation was made by Paz Marquez Benitez of the University of the Philippines. However, the most popular version was written by Mary A. Lane and Senator Camillo Osias, known as the “Philippine Hymn”. On December 5, 1938, the Philippine Congress passed Commonwealth Act 382, which made the anthem’s English words and Felipe’s music official.

A Tagalog (the Filipino language) version of the words started appearing in the 1940’s. In 1948, the Department of Education approved “O Sintang Lupa” (O Beloved Land) as the national anthem’s Filipino words. In 1954, Education Secretary Gregorio Hernandez, Jr., created a committee to revise the words. The new version, entitled “Lupang Hinirang,” was adopted (a minor revision was made in 1962), and is still in use today. Since the passage of the 1998 law about the national symbols (RA 8491), the national anthem can only be sung in Tagalog (the national language) and using only the music composed by Felipe. However, that has not prevented other translations from being created, such as Ilonggo.

Alab ng puso
Sa dibdib mo’y buhay

Lupang Hinirang,
Duyan ka ng Magiting,
Sa manlulupig
Di ka pasisiil.

Sa simoy at sa langit mong bughaw,
May dilag ang tula
At awit sa paglayang minamahal

Ang kislap ng watawat mo’y
Tagumpay na nagniningning;
Ang bituin at araw niya,
Kailan pa ma’y di magdidilim

Lupa ng araw, ng luwalhati’t pagsinta,
Buhay ay langit sa piling mo,
Aming ligaya, na pag may mang-aapi,

Beloved country,
Pearl of the Orient,
The heart’s fervor,
In your chest is ever alive.

Chosen land,
You are the cradle of the brave.
To the conquerors,
You shall never win.

Through the seas and mountains,
Through the air and your blue sky,
There is splendor in the poem and song
For beloved freedom.

The sparkle of your flag
Is shining victoriously.
Its stars and sun
Shall forever never dim.

Land of the sun, of glory and our affections,
Life is heaven in your arms;
It is our pleasure, when there are oppressors,
To die for you.

		<string>info from sources in Wiehler emailShortly before independence, an interim anthem hastily written by Jagnnath Azad, a Hindu, was put into use at the time of Pakistan’s independence in August, 1947.Wiehler end  Then in December, 1948, a committee to select a national anthem for Pakistan was formed. A member of the committee, Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla, was asked to produce a composition. Mr. Chagla’s background in music involves study in both western and eastern music, and characteristics of eastern music can be found in the anthem.

After some “test runs” which included performances for the Prime Minister, for a visiting head of state, for the Prime Minister’s visit to the United States, and finally for the committee itself, it was then approved by the anthem committee in August 1950 and gained official recognition in December 1953. The words, written in a highly Persianized form of the national language, Urdu, were composed by another member of the committee and officially approved in August 1954.  The anthem is sometimes referred to by its first line (“Pak sarzamin shad bad” (Blessed Be The Sacred Land))

		<string>The Polish national anthem was written in July 1797 in Reggio near Bolonia by Józef Wybicki, one of the organisers of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski’s Polish Army in Italy. The theme of the original poem was a novel idea in the era of the nation state (that is, most European nations were made up of eponymous nationalities), that the nation does not need a territory to be a nation, it only needs a group of people.  This idea was a timely one, as Poland had only been partitioned out of existence only two years earlier.  Several more times in subsequent Polish history would an independent Polish nation appear then disappear from the map, which could explain why the song resonates with Poles even today.  The original poem also mentions several Polish war heroes of the time, as well as heroes of past Polish wars; also Napoleon is mentioned, as the commanding officer of Dąbrowski and as an example to be held up.

The source of the melody is unclear; it is usually ascribed to Michal Kleofas Oginski, but this has not been determined with certainty. It is most likely based on an anonymous fok song, due to the unusual mazurka tempo (which is often played at a faster rate than most anthems); mazurkas originated in Poland and have always been heavily associated with that nation.

Its familiar mazurka melody and its message – a call to join the fight for independence – inspired numerous 19th century patriotic songs and national hymns of the Slavonic nations under foreign rule (some of which would later become Yugoslavia, which could explain the similar melody of the former Yugoslav anthem.) The opening line of the lyrics was also borrowed by Ukraine (which, of course, speaks of the Ukraine not perishing rather than Poland.) In the early years after Poland’s revival in 1918, during the debate about the choice of the national anthem, several candidates were considered. On February 28, 1927 the choice of “Dąbrowski’s Mazurka” as the national anthem was officially announced.

		<string>“Fida’i” was declared the anthem of Palestinians by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (an organization charged with the governance of Arab Palestinians) in 1972, in advance of their 1988 declaration of independence. The anthem, also known as the “Anthem of the Intifada” (or “Anthem of the Palestinian Revolution”) firas startwas written by Said Al Muzayin (also known as Fata Al Thawra (“The Rebel Boy”)), and its music was composed by Egyptian maestro Ali Ismael.firas end  While being the official national anthem for use in the areas currently controlled by the Palestinian government, “Mawtini” is considered an “unofficial Palestinian anthem”, popular with many Palestinians, and was considered the Palestinian anthem before “Fida’i” was adopted.

firas startThe word “فدائي” (fida’i), in addition to being the anthem’s title, appears several times in the anthem as well.  The term is difficult to express in a single word or two in English; it refers to a man (the feminine form is “fida’iya”, plural is “fida’iyeen”) who is willing to sacrifice his life. The object that he will sacrifice to can be anything, his lover, tribe, religion, etc., but in the modern sense it is usually meant as a sacrifice to your country.firas end  It has been translated various ways in the anthem, depending on context, the terms “sacrificer”, “resistor”, “freedom fighter” or “revolutionary” could all express the intended meaning to an extent.

Special thanks to: Firas Al-Taher for some of the information about this anthem as well as the Romanized Arabic lyrics.

		<string>“A Portuguesa” was written in response to the British ultimatum in 1890 to Portugal regarding territorial control of Africa. Anywhere there was protests against the monarchy as a result, “A Portuguesa” could be heard. The song still echoes the original intent, the verses and especially the chorus speak of a call to arms, the third verse speaks of “insults” and “embarrassment” (which is how the Portuguese saw the British ultimatum), and the original last line of the chorus read “Contra os bretões marchar, marchar” (Against the British we march, we march!). With the success of the Republicans in ousting the monarchy and replacing them with a democratic government in 1910, “A Portuguesa” was approved as a national anthem shortly after; it is the first verse and chorus that is usually presented as the anthem. 

In 1956, there were a number of variations of the anthem, not just in its melodic line but also in the instrumentation. Recognizing this, the government named a commission charged with determining the official version of “A Portuguesa.” This commission prepared a proposal which, approved by the Council of Ministers on 16 July 1957, remains in effect to this day.</string>

		<string>Paraguay’s first anthem was adopted in 1831, called “Tetã purahéi”, and written by Anastacio Rolón completely in the native Guarnaní language (the ruler of the time, José Gaspar Rodríguez,  refused it to be translated into Spanish, and insisted that it always be performed in Guarnaní).   A later president, Carlos Antonio López, translated it into Spanish in 1845 as the “Himno de la independencia” (Anthem of Independence) as a literal translation of the Guarnaní.  It is unknown who wrote the music, or what it was.

During López’ presidency, he requested Francisco Esteban Acuña de Figueroa, the lyricist of Uruguay’s anthem, to write a new anthem for the country.  It was completed on May 20, 1846 and approved as the national anthem that year.  It is unknown who created the original music of the anthem (some sources list Francisco José Debali, who was also the composer of Uruguay’s anthem), but in 1934, Paraguayan composer Remberto Giménez rearranged and developed the version of the anthem in use today.

Paraguay’s anthem is a classic example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. The seven verses of the anthem also resemble other nations’ anthems of this type, for example, the first three verses of Paraguay’s anthem, recalling its history and specific events, is very similar to the theme of Honduras‘ anthem, whereas the fourth verse which praises the national symbols, and the last three verses, which are a call to patriotism, are common themes in these type of anthems.

1. A los pueblos de América, infausto  
tres centurias un cetro oprimió,  
Mas un día soberbio surgiendo,  
¡basta!, dijo … y el cetro rompió.
Nuestros padres, lidiando, grandiosos,  
ilustraron su gloria marcial,  
y trozada la augusta diadema,  
enalzaron el gorro triunfal.

CHORUS:
¡Paraguayos, República, o muerte!  
Nuestro brío nos dio libertad:  
ni opresores, ni siervos alientan  
donde reinen unión e igualdad.
 
2. Nueva Roma, la Patria ostentara  
dos caudillos de nombre y valer,  
que rival, cual Romulo y Remo  
dividieron gobierno y poder.
Largos años, cual Febo entre nubes  
vióse oculta la perla del Sud,  
hoy un Héroe grandioso aparece  
realzando su gloria y virtud …

Chorus

3. Con aplauso la Europa y el Mundo  
la saludan y aclaman también  
de heroísmo baluarte invencible,  
de riquezas magnifico Edén.
Cuando en torno rugió la Discordia  
que otros pueblos fatal devoró,  
paraguayos; el suelo sagrado,  
con sus alas un ángel cubrió.

Chorus

4. ¡Oh, cuán pura, de lauro ceñida,  
dulce patria, te ostentas así!  
En tu enseña se ven los colores  
del zafiro, diamante y rubí.
En tu escudo que el sol ilumina  
bajo el gorro se mira al león.  
Doble imagen de fuertes y libres  
y de glorias, recuerdo y blasón.

Chorus

5. De la tumba del vil feudalismo  
se alza libre la patria Deidad;  
opresores ¡doblad la rodilla!,  
compatriotas ¡el Himno entonad!
Suene el grito: ¡República o muerte!  
Nuestros pechos lo exhalen con fe  
y sus ecos repiten los montes,  
cual gigantes poniéndose en pie.

Chorus

6. Libertad y Justicia defiende  
nuestra Patria, ¡Tiranos, oíd!  
De sus fueros la carta sagrada  
su heroísmo sustenta en la lid.
Contra el mundo si el mundo se opone,  
si intentare su prenda insultar,  
batallando vengarla sabremos  
¡Oh, abrazados con ella expirar!

Chorus

7. Alza, oh, pueblo, tu espada esplendente  
que fulmina destellos  de Dios,  
no hay más medio que libre o esclavo  
y un abismo divide a los dos.
En las auras el himno resuene,  
repitiendo con eco triunfal:  
¡A los Libres, perinclita gloria!  
¡A La Patria, laurel inmortal!

1. For three centuries a reign oppressed
The unhappy peoples of America,
But one day, their anger aroused, they said:
“An end to this!” and broke the reign.
Our forefathers, fighting magnificently,
Displayed their martial glory,
And when the august diadem was shattered,
They raised the triumphal cap of liberty.

CHORUS:
Paraguayans, Republic or death!
It was our strength that gave us our final liberty.
Neither tyrants nor slaves can continue,
Where unity and equality reign,
Where unity and equality reign.

2. A new Rome, the Fatherland shall proudly display
Two leaders of name and valor
Who, rivals, like Romulus and Remus
Divided government and power.
Long years, during which Phoebus in the clouds
Saw darken the pearl of the South,
Today a grand hero appears
Raising up again her glory and virtue…

Chorus

3. Europe and the world salute her with applause
And also acclaim
Invincible bastion of heroism,
Magnificent Eden of riches.
(But) when discord rumbled all around
Which fatally devoured other Peoples,
Paraguayans, the sacred ground
Was covered by an angel with its wings.

Chorus

4. Oh, how pure, of laurel girded
Sweet Fatherland, in this manner you show yourself.
In your ensign one sees the colors
Of sapphire, diamond, and ruby.
In your coat of arms, which the Sun illuminates,
Under the cap, one sees the lion.
Double image of the strong and the free,
And of glories, the memory and crest.

Chorus

5. From the tomb of vile feudalism
The national Deity rises free;
Oppressors, bend your knees!
Compatriots, entone the hymn!
Sound the cry, “Republic or death”!
Our breasts exhale it with faith,
And the mountains repeat its echoes
Like giants arising.

Chorus

6. Our Fatherland defends liberty and justice;
Tyrants: listen!
The laws in its sacred charter
Will sustain its heroism in the fight.
Against the world, if the world opposes it,
If the world dares to insult her security,
Battling to avenge we shall know her
Or die embracing her.

Chorus

7. Arise, oh People, your splendid sword
That strikes with sparkles of God,
There is no middle ground between free or slave
And an abyss divides the two.
In the gentle breezes the Hymn resounds,
Repeating with triumphal echo:
For the free, renowned glory!
For the Fatherland, immortal laurel!

Chorus

		<string>Written during the 1848 revolution by Andrei Mureşianu and set to the music of Anton Pann by Gheorghe Ucenescu and originally titled “Un răsunet” (An Echo), the poem’s theme of revolution, liberty, and patriotism, quickly became popular with Romanians, especially in subsequent national struggles, earning the song the nickname of the “Romanian Marseillaise“.  It was first used as a national anthem by the short-lived Moldavian Democratic Republic in 1917-1918 (and was the first anthem in use by independent Moldova from 1991-1994) and was long regarded as an unofficial Romanian anthem.  It was heard frequently during the protests against the communist government in late 1989 and was officially confirmed as the national anthem in the spring of 1990.  The original work has eleven verses, but only four (verses 1, 2, 4, and 11) are usually performed as the official lyrics (although on special occasions, such as National Anthem Day (July 29, the anniversary of its first performance in 1848), the full lyrics can sometimes be heard).</string>

1. Deşteaptă-te, române, din somnul cel de moarte,  
În care te-adânciră barbarii de tirani  
Acum ori niciodată croieşte-ţi altă soarte,  
La care să se-nchine şi cruzii tăi duşmani.  
      
2. Acum ori niciodată să dăm dovezi în lume  
Că-n aste mâni mai curge un sânge de roman,  
Şi că-n a noastre piepturi păstrăm cu fală-un nume  
Triumfător în lupte, un nume de Traian.  

4. Priviţi, măreţe umbre, Mihai, Ştefan, Corvine,

Now, or never, your fate renew,
To which your enemies will bow to.

That in these veins still flows a Roman blood,
That in our chests we still maintain our pride in a name
The victor in his battles, the name of Trajan!

4. Watch on, shadows of highnesses, Mihai, Stefan, Corvinus,
The Romanian Nation, your great grandchildren,
With weapons in their arms, with your fire in their veins,
“Life in freedom or death!” shout all.

11. Priests, lead with your crucifixes! Because our army is Christian,
The motto is Liberty and its goal is holy,
Better to die in battle, in full glory,
Than to once again be slaves upon our ancient ground!

		<string>Written in 1872 as part of a play, the popularity of “Bože Pravde” helped to have it officially adopted as the Serbian anthem in 1904, after Serbia became an independent nation in the 1880s. Upon forming the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later to be called Yugoslavia) in 1918, “Bože Pravde” was retained as the anthem of the Serbs within the federation. In fact, the first anthem of the federation, in use until 1945, uses part of “Bože Pravde” in the melody to represent the Serbs of the land.

After World War II, “Bože Pravde” continued to be popular with Serbs, and identified as their anthem. During the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s, Serbian areas that broke away from Croatia (Krajina) and Bosnia (Srpska) also used “Bože Pravde” upon their creation to identify themselves as a Serbian state. In August, 2004, 18 months after Yugoslavia became the new federation of Serbia and Montenegro, “Bože Pravde” was recommended as Serbia’s anthem by the Serb national assembly and was constitutionally adopted upon the dissolution of the union and the regaining of Serbian independence in 2006.  Although the anthem has four verses officially, it is usually only the first that is performed.

The original lyrics, present in the former Yugoslav anthem, refer to the Serbian monarchy, which was replaced with a republican-style government in 1945. The current lyrics of the Serbian anthem replace the references to the king with references to the Serbian race. The music of the anthem is by a Slovene, Davorin Jenko.

Death or victory to embrace-

Strengthen then the Serbian race.
God of armies! be our leader
Strengthen then the Serbian race.

4. On our sepulchre of ages
Breaks the resurrection morn,
From the slough of direst slavery
Serbia anew is born.

Through five hundred years of durance
We have knelt before Thy face,
All our kin, O God! deliver,
Thus entreats the Serbian race. 
All our kin, O God! deliver,
Thus entreats the Serbian race.

		<string>In late 2000, Russia’s new president Vladimir Putin, made creation of a new anthem for Russia a top priority, since a common complaint was not having words to their current anthem. In early December 2000, Putin presented a bill in the national asssembly to have the melody of the old anthem from the Soviet Union adopted as the new national anthem.  The measure passed by a wide margin on December 8, but it was not without controversy, both at the time and since.  Many (including former President Yeltsin) did not feel a change was necessary, and the use of the old Soviet anthem could be seen as rejecting post-Communist reforms.  Others have expressed concerns that the melody brings back memories of the past of hardships under the Communist regime, especially the crimes that took place under Stalin (who was Soviet leader when the anthem was first introduced).

It was then needed to adopt lyrics for the anthem, as the Communist-era lyrics would be inappropriate.  After reviewing thousands of entries, new lyrics by Sergei Vladimirovich Mikhalkov (the same person who wrote the lyrics to the old Soviet anthem) were adopted.  The lyrics were also not without controversy as well, the main one being that the words were not well-known (perhaps due to the fact that this was the third set of words used for the melody since its introduction in 1944).  Others, particularly the Communist deputies in the legislature, who were in favour of adopting Alexandrov’s melody, objected to the reference to God in the anthem.

Special thanks to: Pavel Zinovatny for some of this information, and the English translation of the lyrics.

1. Rwanda nziza gihugu cyacu
Wuje imisozi, ibiyaga n’ibirunga
Ngobyi iduhetse gahorane ishya.
Rekatukurate tukuvuge ibigwi
Wowe utubumbiye hamwe twese
Abanyarwanda uko watubyaye
Berwa, sugira, singizwa iteka.

2. Horana Imana murage mwiza
Ibyo tugukesha ntibishyikirwa:
Umuco dusangiye uraturanga
Ururimi rwacu rukaduhuza
Ubwenge, umutima, amaboko yacu
Nibigukungahaze bikwiye
Nuko utere imbere ubutitsa.

3. Abakurambere b’intwari
Bitanze batizigama
Baraguhanga uvamo ubukombe
Utsinda ubukoroni na mpatsebihugu
Byayogoje Afurika yose
None uraganje mu bwigenge
Tubikomeyeho uko turi twese.

4. Komeza imihigo rwanda dukunda
Duhagurukiye kukwitangira
Ngo amahoro asabe mu bagutuye
Wishyire wizane muri byose
Urangwe n’ishyaka, utere imbere
Uhamye umubano n’amahanga yose
Maze ijabo ryawe riguhe ijambo.

1. Rwanda, our beautiful and dear country
Adorned of hills, lakes and volcanoes 
Motherland, would be always filled of happiness 
Us all your children: Abanyarwanda
Let us sing your glare and proclaim your high facts 
You, maternal bosom of us all 
Would be admired forever, prosperous and cover of praises.

2. Invaluable heritage, that God protects to you 
You filled us priceless goods 
Our common culture identifies us 
Our single language unifies us 
That our intelligence, our conscience and our forces 
Fill you with varied riches
For an unceasingly renewed development.

3. Our valorous ancestors
Gave themselves bodies and souls 
As far as making you a big nation
You overcame the colonial-imperialistic yoke
That has devastated Africa entirely
And has your joy of your sovereign independence
Acquired that constantly we will defend. 

4. Maintain this cape, beloved Rwanda,
Standing, we commit for you
So that peace reigns countrywide
That you are free of all hindrance
That your determination hires progress
That you have excellent relations with all countries
And that finally your pride is worth your esteem.

		<string>In 1947, Saudi Arabia lacked an anthem, so, when King Abdulaziz visited Egypt that year, he asked Egyptian composer Abdul Rahman Al-Khateeb to create an anthem and “Aash Al Maleek” was created.  The melody, an Arab fanfare style, is similar to those of other Arab states in the area at the time.  In 1958, the first set of lyrics were written for the anthem by Mohammed Talat, Ragozat, Die Nationalhynmen der Welt (1982) per meltzer-but weren’t often heard.ragozat end  In 1984 King Fahd ask poet Ibrahim Al Khafaji to write new lyrics, which are the official lyrics today.</string>

		<string>Sweden’s anthem was written in 1844. The author of the lyrics chose a Swedish folk tune from the province of Västmanland to set his words to to create the anthem and entitled it “Sång till Norden” (Song of the North). nenzelius startThe song was created at a time when a “pan-Scandinavian” movement was strong, which is why it is a “Song to the North” instead of just to Sweden. nenzelius end  This has led to other verses being written that are more patriotic to Sweden, but these additional verses have never gained popularity and have never been considered part of the national anthem.

stolt startIn the late 19th century the anthem started to be considered as Sweden’s “national anthem”, differentiating it from the royal anthem that was being used as both a royal and national anthem.stolt end The anthem has never been officially legislated as Sweden’s national anthem, one attempt in the 1930s by a member of parliament brought forth claims by the opposition of wanting state controlled patriotism. stolt start(However, a bill in 1960 which attempted to make a different song the national anthem was defeated, which indirectly gave official support to “Sång till Norden”.)stolt end

		<string>The National Anthem was written in the wake of nationalism during 1956-57. Its composer and author, Zubir Said, had written it on the basis of two words, “Majulah Singapura” or “Onward Singapore”, as a theme for the city council’s official functions.  It was first performed in 1958 at the Victoria Theatre. After Singapore attained self government, the song was slightly re-written and was re-introduced in 1959, at the installation of the new head of state and the introduction of the state (later national) flag. The anthem was used as a state song within Malaysia, of which it was a part, and was adopted as a national anthem in 1965 upon independence.

In 2000, the anthem underwent a slight change in that the official arrangement was made more solemn and inspiring. The new version, arranged by Phoon Yew Tien, was officially recorded at the Victoria Concert Hall in November of that year (where the first performance took place 42 years earlier) and was officially unveiled in January, 2001.

Although Singapore has four official languages (Malay, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Tamil), the anthem is only to be sung in the original Malay lyrics, not any translation, tjut startas Malay is indigenous to the region and is designated the National Languagetjut end. (As such, the English translation is presented here, as on several other pages on this site, as a guide for reader comprehension only.)

		<string>“Zdravljica” was written by France Prešeren, considered as Slovenia’s national poet, as a drinking song (in his original manuscript, the layout of the words resemble a wine glass), but also was seen as politically charged piece when it was written in 1844 as it spoke of pan-Slavic nationalism, which was controversial in Austria-Hungary (which Slovenia was part of at the time).  It was finally published in 1848, after revolutions in Austria-Hungary lifted the censorship.

In 1905, Zdravljica was set to music for the first time, the entire poem had a choral composition composed for it by Stanko Premrl, and this was the composition chosen as the Slovenian anthem in September 1989.  The constitution of Slovenia, adopted on December 23, 1991, does not specify a specific verse and just states that “Zdravljica” is the national anthem.  The 1994 act regulating the flag, anthem, and other symbols states that is is just the seventh verse that is the anthem, and in government publications and in practice, only the seventh verse (as also presented here) is the anthem.</string>

		<string>Until the breakup of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the Slovak anthem was used as part of the Czechoslovak anthem. The melody of the anthem, long used as an unofficial anthem, is that of a Slovak folk song entitled “Kopala studienku”. The lyrics were written by a Slovak student who was one of those who joined other students in an exodus from Bratislava to Levoča in 1843 in protest over the firing of a teacher who had Slovak nationalist views; the Tatras, mentioned in the first verse, are a mountain range the students would have passed through on their way from Bratislava to eastern Slovakia, and have been used as a symbol of the nation as a whole.

The song quickly became popular with Slovaks, especially the other students involved in the protest and was used as the Slovak anthem when Czechoslovakia was created.  Upon restoration of Slovak independence in 1993, the anthem was made the anthem of Slovakia, slightly altering the version in use until then by replacing the phrase “Zastavme sa” (“Let us pause”), which was a common variant to that point, with “Zastavme ich” (“Let us stop them”), which was determined to be the original words in Matúška’s poem.</string>

1. Pincez tous vos Koras,frappez les balafons.
Le lion a rugi.
Le dompteur de la brousse
D’un bond s’est élancé
Dissipant les ténèbres.
Soleil sur nos terreurs,soleil sur notre espoir.
Debout, frères, voici l’Afrique rassemblée

CHORUS:
Fibres de mon coeur vert.
Épaule contre épaule, mes plus que frères,
O Sénégalais, debout!
Unissons la mer et les sources,unissons la steppe et la forêt!
Salut Afrique mère, salut Afrique mère.

2. Sénégal toi le fils de l’écume du Lion, 
Toi surgi de la nuit au galop des chevaux, 
Rend-nous, oh! rends-nous l’honneur de nos Ancêstres, 
Splendides comme ébène et forts comme le muscle 
Nous disons droits-l’épée n’a pas une bavure. 

Chorus

3. Sénégal, nous faisons nôtre ton grand dessein:
Rassembler les poussins à l’abri des milans
Pour en faire, de l’Est à l’Ouest, du Nord au Sud,
Dressé, un même peuple, un peuple sans couture
Mais un peuple tourné vers tous les vents du monde.

Chorus

4. Sénégal, comme toi, comme tous nos héros,
Nous serons durs sans haine et des deux bras ouverts.
L’épée, nous la mettrons dans la paix du fourreau,
Car le travail sera notre arme et la parole.
Le Bantou est un frère, et l’Arabe et le Blanc.

Chorus

5. Mais que si l’ennemi incendie nos frontières
Nous serons tous dressés et les armes au poing:
Un Peuple dans sa foi défiant tous les malheurs,
Les jeunes et les vieux, les hommes et les femmes.
La Mort, oui! Nous disons la Mort, mais pas la honte.

1. Sound, all of you, your Koras, 
Beat the drums, 
The red Lion has roared,
The Tamer of the bush with one leap has rushed forward
Scattering the gloom.
Light on our terrors,
Light on our hopes.
Arise, brothers, Africa behold united!

CHORUS:
Shoulder to shoulder,
O people of Senegal, more than brothers to me, arise!
Unite the sea and the springs,
Unite the steppe and the forest!
Hail, mother Africa,
Hail, mother Africa! 

2. Senegal, thou son of the Lion
Arise in the night with great speed,
Restore, oh, restore to us the honour of our ancestors,
Magnificent as ebony and strong as muscles!
We are a straight people-the sword has no fault.

Chorus

3. Senegal, we make your great design our own:
To gather the chicks, sheltering them from kites,
To make from them, from East to West, from North to South,
A people rising as one, in seamless unity,
Yet a people facing all the winds of the earth.

Chorus

4. Senegal, like thee, like all our heroes,
We will be stern without hatred, and with open arms.
The sword we will put peacefully in its sheath,
For work and words will be our weapon.
The Bantu is our brother, the Arab, and the White man too.

Chorus

5. But if the enemy violates our frontiers,
We will all be ready, weapons in our hands;
A people in its faith defying all evil;
Young and old, men and women,
Death, yes! but not dishonour.  

Chorus

		<string>Somalia’s flag was first flown in 1954, 6 years before Somali independence, as a symbol of the Somali people.  The song “Qolobaa Calankeed” was written the following year to celebrate the adoption of a flag for the Somali people.  After a long period of governmental instability, the song was proclaimed as the new Somali anthem in the August 1, 2012 constitution as a break from the past.</string>

		<string>The anthem has its beginnings in a Sunday School song written in 1893 by Cornelis Atses Hoekstra called “Suriname’s Trotsche Stroomen” (Suriname’s Proud Streams).  The song was set to a piece of music by Johannes Corstianus de Puy written in 1876.  In 1959, after self-government was granted, the government asked the poet Henry de Ziel (whose pen name was Trefossa) to write lyrics for the anthem in the language popularly spoken in Suriname, Sranan Tongo.  He also revised Hoekstra’s lyrics of the second verse to remove the “negative tones” in some lines.  Originally the anthem was song with de Ziel’s verse first, but now it is perfomed with Hoekstra’s Dutch verse first and de Ziel’s Sranan lyrics as the second verse.

		<string>In preparation for the upcoming independence referendum in January, 2011, the South Sudan National Anthem Committee asked a group of 49 writers to come up with an anthem for the country.  After being guidelines by the army and government, which stated that the anthem had to include mentions of its history, people, and resources, as well as being told about the struggle for independence, lyrics were then chosen by means of a televised competition.  Originally under the working title “Land of Cush” (in reference to a Biblical kingdom which is roughly located in the area of South Sudan), the lyrics were revised several times in the following months after the successful independence referendum, and a final version was settled in March, 2011, which slightly altered the wording (among other things replacing the word “Cush” with “South Sudan”).

And sing songs of freedom with joy

Saluting our martyrs whose blood
Cemented our national foundation
We vow to protect our nation

		<key>info</key>
		<string>One of the longest national anthems in existence (that is, in the style that it’s usually performed, with the musical introduction, the chorus, the first verse, and the chorus again), the Salvadoran anthem is a typical example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. It was commonly adopted as the National Song on September 15, 1879 but did not have official recognition until December 11, 1953.

The anthem was composed by an Italian composer that arrived in the country at the end of the 18th Century as the Director of an opera company and written by General Juan José Cañas, a poet and distinguished military officer, around the year 1856. It was composed at the recommendation of the president Dr. Rafael Zaldívar and was sung for the first time on September 15, 1879 at the National Palace by children and young students from government and private schools of the capital city, and the anthem was very well recieved after the initial performance.

1. De la paz en la dicha suprema 
siempre noble soñó El Salvador; 
fue obtenerla su eterno problema, 
conservarla es su gloria mayor.   
Y con fe inquebrantable el camino 
del progreso se afana en seguir; 
por llenar su grandioso destino: 
conquistarse un feliz porvenir.   
Le protege una férrea barrera 
contra el choque de ruin deslealtad 
desde el día que en su alta bandera 
con su sangre escribió: ¡LIBERTAD!   
escribió: ¡LIBERTAD!, escribió: ¡LIBERTAD!   

Chorus

2. Libertad es su dogma, es su guía 
que mil veces logró defender; 
y otras tantas, de audaz tiranía 
rechazar el odioso poder.   
Dolorosa y sangrienta es su historia, 
pero excelsa y brillante a la vez; 
manantial de legítima gloria, 
gran lección de espartana altivez.   
No desmaya en su innata bravura, 
en cada hombre hay un héroe inmortal 
que sabrá mantenerse a la altura 
de su antiguo valor proverbial.   
valor proverbial, valor proverbial.   

Chorus

3. Todos son abnegados, y fieles 
al prestigio del bélico ardor 
con que siempre segaron laureles 
de la patria salvando el honor.   
Respetar los derechos extraños 
y apoyarse en la recta razón 
es para ella, sin torpes amaños 
su invariable, más firme ambición.   
Y en seguir esta línea se aferra 
dedicando su esfuerzo tenaz, 
en hacer cruda guerra a la guerra; 
su ventura se encuentra en la paz. 
encuentra en la paz, encuentra en la paz.

1. Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness,
El Salvador has always nobly dreamed.
To achieve this has been her eternal proposition,
To keep it, her greatest glory.
With inviolable faith, she eagerly follows
The way of progress
In order to fulfil her high destiny
And achieve a happy future.
A stern barrier protects her
Against the clash of vile disloyalty,
Ever since the day when her lofty banner,
In letters of blood, wrote “Freedom”,
Wrote “Freedom”, wrote “Freedom”.

Chorus

2. Freedom is her dogma and her guide;
A thousand times she has defended it,
And as many times has she repelled
The hateful power of atrocious tyranny.
Her history has been bloody and sad,
Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant,
A source of legitimate glory
And a great lesson in Spartan pride.
Her innate bravery shall not waver:
In every man there is an immortal hero
Who knows how to maintain the level
Of the proverbial valour of old.
Valour of old, valour of old.

Chorus

3. All are self-denying and faithful
To the tradition of warlike ardour
With which they have always reaped fame
By saving the motherland’s honour.
To respect the rights of others
And base her actions on right and justice
Is for her, without infamous intrigue,
The constant and most firm ambition.
And in following this line she persists,
Dedicating her tenacious efforts
In giving hard battle for battle; 
Her happiness is found in peace, 
Is found in peace, is found in peace.

Chorus

		<string>The national anthem of Syria was adopted in 1936; the composers of the music also composed many other Arab folk songs of the Middle East region.  During the time that Syria was a member of the United Arab Republic (1958-1961), the UAR anthem was in use, which consisted of the then-Egyptian anthem followed by “Ħumāt ad-Diyār”. Once Syria left the union, the anthem was again performed on its own.

The abode of Arabism,
A hallowed sanctuary;
The seat of the stars,

Towers in the heights,
Resembling the sky
Above the clouds.
A land resplendant
With brilliant suns,
Becoming another sky,
Or almost a sky.

		<string>The national anthem, adopted in 1968 on independence, was composed after extensive ethno-musicological fieldwork in Swaziland. The national anthem was a compromise between Swazi and western styles of music. Swazi music stresses on songs with inticrate polyphony, which is evident in the anthem, making this anthem one of the best examples of the “Eastern folk” style of anthem.</string>

1. Salut à toi, pays de nos aïeux!
Toi qui les rendais forts, paisibles et joyeux,
Cultivant vertu, vaillance
Pour la postérité.
Que viennent les tyrans, ton coeur soupire vers la liberté.

Vainquons ou mourons, mais dans la dignité.
Grand Dieu, Toi seul nous as exaltés
Du Togo pour la prospérité,
Togolais, viens! Batissons la Cité!

2. Dans l’unité nous voulons te servir,
C’est bien là de nos coeurs le plus ardent désir.
Clamons fort notre devise
Que rien ne peut ternir.
Seuls artisans de ton bonheur ainsi que de ton avenir,
Brisons partout les chaînes, la traîtrise
Et nous te jurons toujours fidélité
Et aimer, servir, se dépasser,
Faire encore de toi sans nous lasser
Togo Chéri, l’Or de l’Humanité.

3. Salut, Salut à l’Univers entier
Unissons nos efforts sur l’immense chantier
D’où naîtra toute nouvelle
La Grande Humanité
Partout au lieu de la misère, apportons la félicité.

Finis l’esclavage et la Captivité
A l’étoile de la liberté,
Renouons la solidarité
Des Nations dans la fraternité

		<string>The current Thai anthem is actually the latest of many used in the history of the country, although few have enjoyed the longevity the current anthem has.

The notion of a Thai (or Siamese, as Thailand was then known as Siam) anthem was first raised in 1871, when the king, upon visiting the British colony of Singapore, noticed that the British had a national anthem, so one should be made for his country. The first anthem, written by Phraya Sri Sunthornvoharn and entitled “Jom Raj Jong Charoen” (Long Live the King), was derived from an anthem written by two British officers who trained the military band. This anthem proved unpopular, and the second, “Bulan Loy Luen” (Moving Moon), was composed and written by King Rama II.

The third anthem, “Phleng Sansasoen Phra Barami” (A Salute to the Monarch) is still in use today as the royal anthem, but it ceased being the national anthem after the 1932 coup. A short lived song, “Chart Mahachai” was the national anthem for a while, but the coup planners wanted to have the composer Peter Feit (known in Thailand as Phra Jenduriyang) compse an anthem for the citizenry in the spirit of “La Marseillaise”. With lyrics by Khun Wichitmatra the new anthem was played for the first time in July, 1932, and the lyrics were subsequently rewritten two years later by Chan Kamwilai. When the nation’s name was changed to Thailand from Siam in 1939, it was decided new lyrics should be written, and the lyrics by Luang Saranuprapan won the contest and remain the lyrics today. It was also ordered around this time that the anthem must be played every day at 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. when the national flag is also to be raised and lowered. The citizens must stand and show respect for the nation when the anthem is heard. This law remains in force today.

Thailand embraces in its bosom all people of Thai blood.
Every inch of Thailand belongs to the Thais.
It has long maintained its sovereignty,
Because the Thais have always been united.
The Thai people are peace-loving,
But they are no cowards at war.
They shall allow no one to rob them of their independence,
Nor shall they suffer tyranny.
All Thais are ready to give up every drop of blood
For the nation’s safety, freedom and progress. Hurrah!

		<string>On May 20, 2002, this former part of Indonesia also known as East Timor regained the independence it had briefly until Indonesia took over the island following Portuguese withdrawal from the territory in 1975. It was a logical choice for the new nation to adopt, as the anthem was first played upon its original declaration of independence. It remained the national anthem until the country was invaded by and incorporated into Indonesia a few days later (the Indonesian anthem was then officially used in the territory). The author of the lyrics, poet Francisco Borja da Costa, was killed in the Indonesian invasion.

The official lyrics are in Portuguese, however they have been translated into Tetum, the other official language that is native to the country.  However, these lyrics seem to be just a translation and don’t appear to fit the music.</string>

		<string>After the passing of its first President, the Turkmen anthem had to be re-written to remove references to him in the anthem lyrics. The new lyrics substitutes “the people” instead and the lyrics remain relatively the same. Also, the music has been slightly changed by switching the order of the verse and chorus, in the new version the verse precedes the chorus.

		<string>The lyrics of the Tunisian anthem were written by an Egyptian in the 1930s. Originally just one verse, another two were added by the Tunisian national poet Aboul-Qacem Echebbi. The music was composed by the same person who wrote the music of the anthems of Libya and the United Arab Emirates. It was first used as an interim anthem after the deposition of the monarchy, between the times when the Bey’s anthem was abolished and the first anthem under the republic was instituted.  It was then introduced again in 1987 since the previous anthem was closely tied to the government of Habib Bourguiba, who had been deposed.</string>

		<string>The anthem was first performed in 1874, though it probably was in use earlier.  Officially it is named “Ko e fasi ʻo e tuʻi ʻo e ʻOtu Tonga”, but it is more popularly known as “Fasi Fakafonua”.  The anthem references King Tupou; while this was the name of the king of Tonga when the anthem was written, it is also the name of the Tongan Royal House, and therefore of every Tongan ruler since 1874.

		<string>The “İstiklâl Marşı” was officially adopted as Turkey’s national anthem on March 12, 1921. 724 poems were submitted to a competition organized to find and select the most suitable original composition, and a poem written by the poet Mehmet Akif Ersoy was adopted unanimously by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. There are ten verses to Ersoy’s poem, but only the first two are usually sung as the national anthem.

Twenty-four composers participated in another competition arranged for the selection of a musical composition for the National Anthem. The Council, which was only able to convene in 1924 due to the War of Independence, adopted the music composed by Ali Rifat Çagatay. The words of the National Anthem were sung to this music for six years. The music of the National Anthem was then changed to an arrangement written by Zeki Üngör, conductor of the Presidental Symphonic Orchestra, and the words of the National Anthem have been sung to this musical accompaniment ever since.

The anthem of Turkey is also used in the Turkish areas of northern Cyprus.</string>

1. Korkma! Sönmez bu şafaklarda yüzen al sancak;
Sönmeden yurdumun üstünde tüten en son ocak.
O benim milletimin yıldızıdır, parlayacak!
O benimdir, o benim milletimindir ancak!
 
2. Çatma kurban olayım, çehreni ey nazlı hilâl;
Kahraman ırkıma bir gül… Ne bu şiddet, bu celâl?
Sana olmaz dökülen kanlarımız sonra helâl;
Hakkıdır Hakk’a tapan, milletimin istiklâl.
 
3. Ben ezelden beridir hür yaşadım, hür yaşarım.
Hangi çılgın bana zincir vuracakmış? Şaşarım!
Kükremiş sel gibiyim: Bendimi çiğner, aşarım.
Yırtarım dağları, enginlere sığmam, taşarım.
 
4. Garb’ın âfâkını sarmışsa çelik zırhlı duvar;
Benim imân dolu göğsüm gibi serhaddim var.
Ulusun, korkma! Nasıl böyle bir îmanı boğar,
“Medeniyyet!” dediğin tek dişi kalmış canavar?
 
5. Arkadaş! Yurduma alçakları uğratma sakın;
Siper et gövdeni, dursun bu hayâsızca akın.
Doğacaktır sana va’dettiği günler Hakk’ın,
Kim bilir, belki yarın, belki yarından da yakın.
 
6. Bastığın yerleri “toprak!” diyerek geçme, tanı!
Düşün altındaki binlerce kefensiz yatanı.
Sen şehîd oğlusun, incitme, yazıktır atanı:
Verme, dünyaları alsan da, bu cennet vatanı.
 
7. Kim bu cennet vatanın uğruna olmaz ki fedâ?
Şühedâ fışkıracak toprağı sıksan, şühedâ!
Cânı, cânânı, bütün varımı alsın da Hudâ,
Etmesin tek vatanımdan beni dünyâda cüdâ.
 
8. Rûhumun senden ilâhî şudur ancak emeli:
Değmesin ma’bedimin göğsüne nâ-mahrem eli!
Bu ezanlar – ki sehâdetleri dînin temeli –
Ebedî, yurdumun üstünde benim inlemeli.
 
9. O zaman vecd ile bin secde eder – varsa – taşım;
Her cerîhamdan, İlâhi, boşanır kanlı yaşım;
Fışkırır rûh-i mücerred gibi yerden na’şım!
O zaman yükselerek Arş’a değer, belki, başım!
 
10. Dalgalan sen de şafaklar gibi ey şanlı hilâl!
Olsun artık dökülen kanlarım hepsi helâl.
Ebediyyen sana yok, ırkıma yok izmihlâl:
Hakkıdır, hür yaşamış, bayrağımın hürriyet;
Hakkıdır, Hakk’a tapan, milletimin istiklâl.

1. Fear not! For the crimson flag that proudly waves in these dawns, shall never fade,
Before the last fiery hearth that is ablaze within my nation burns out.
And that, is the star of my nation, and it will forever shine;
It is mine; and solely belongs to my nation.
 
2. Frown not, I beseech you, oh thou coy crescent,
But smile upon my heroic nation! Why the anger, why the rage?
The blood we shed for you will not be worthy otherwise;
For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation.
 
3. I have been free since the beginning and forever will be so.
What madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea!
I’m like the roaring flood; powerful and independent,
I’ll tear apart mountains, exceed all that is known to Man, and still gush out!
 
4. The lands of the West may be armored with walls of steel,
But I have borders guarded by the mighty chest of a believer.
Recognize your innate strength! And think: how can this fiery faith ever be killed,
By that battered, single-toothed monster you call “civilization”?
 
5. My friend! Leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men!
Render your chest as armor! Stop this disgraceful rush!
For soon shall be come the day of promised freedom…
Who knows? Perhaps tomorrow? Perhaps even sooner!
 
6. See not the soil you tread on as mere earth,
But think about the thousands beneath you that lie without even shrouds.
You’re the noble son of a martyr, take shame, hurt not your ancestor!
Unhand not, even when you’re promised worlds, this paradise of a homeland.
 
7. What man would not die for this heavenly piece of land?
Martyrs would gush out if you just squeeze the soil! Martyrs!
May God take all my loved ones and possessions from me if he will,
But may he not deprive me of my one true homeland for the world.
 
8. O Lord, the sole wish of my heart is that,
No infidel’s hand should touch the bosom of my temple.
These adhans, the shahadah of which is the base of the religion,
Shall sound loud over my eternal homeland.
 
9. Then my tombstone – if there is one – will a thousand times touch its forehead on earth in ecstasy,
O Lord, tears of blood flowing out of my every wound,
My corpse will gush out from the earth like a spirit,
And then, my head will perhaps rise and reach the heavens.
 
10. So flap and wave like the dawning sky, oh glorious crescent,
So that our every last drop of blood may finally be worthy!
Neither you nor my nation shall ever be extinguished!
For freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag;
For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation!

		<string>Patrick Castagne, a songwriter from Trinidad, had originally composed an anthem for the West Indies Federation (a proposed union of British-controlled islands in the West Indies, of which Trinidad was one of the largest in terms of area and population, and was also where the capital was located), however, this federation was dissolved in 1962 (partly due to Trinidad and Tobago striving for independence on its own).  He reworked the song, titled “A Song for Federation”, by slightly altering the text, and submitted it for the contest for the anthem of Trinidad and Tobago.  It was deemed to be the winner, and was played for the first time when independence was granted.

Of Tuvalu we all share
In the knowledge that God
Ever rules in heav’n above,
And that we in this land
Are united in His love.
We build on a sure foundation
When we trust in God’s great law;
“Tuvalu for the Almighty”
Be our song for evermore!

2. Let us trust our lives henceforward
To the King to whom we pray,
With our eyes fixed firmly on Him
He is showing us the way.
“May we reign with Him in glory”
Be our song for evermore,
for His almighty power
Is our strength from shore to shore.
Shout aloud in jubilation
To the King Whom we adore.
“Tuvalu free and united”
Be our song for evermore!

		<string>Tanzania was the first African nation to use the popular African song “God Bless Africa” as its anthem, in 1961 when it was Tanganyika, and was retained after union with Zanzibar in 1964. It is now also used by South Africa (as part of the current anthem) and Zambia (with different words), and formerly used by Zimbabwe, Ciskei, and Transkei.  The version used in Tanzania is in Swahili (the official language of the country) and not in Sontonga’s original lyrics of Xhosa, and was translated by a group of people.

		<string>In 1862, Ukrainian poet and ethnographer Pavlo Chubynskyi wrote a poem “Ще не вмерла Україна” (“Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina”) [Ukraine Is Not Dead Yet] in 1862, which gained a wide popularity among the Ukrainian intelligentsia of the time.  It also caught the attention of Mykhailo Verbytskyi, a priest, and was moved to compose music for the poem; it was first performed as a choral work in 1864 in the Ukraine Theatre in Lvov.

Upon the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1917, a number of patriotic works were used in the capacity of a national anthem, including Chubynskyi’s work, but none of them were officially declared as the national anthem.  In 1920, Ukraine was made part of the Soviet Union, and “Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina” and other patriotic works were officially discouraged.  cahoon per fotw startDuring the second world war, the short lived Carpatho-Ukraine Republic (now located in western Ukraine) adopted “Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina” as its anthem.cahoon end  Upon the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine regained its independence and Chubynskyi’s anthem was the most popular choice already in use as an anthem; when independence was declared no lyrics were officially mandated, the lyrics that were in common use at the time differed somewhat from Chubynskyi’s original poem.

The lyrics were made official in 2003 and changed slightly; the most important change was made to the first line (and title), which were interestingly borrowed from the Polish anthem. In the new version, the case ending of the word “Ukraine” was changed, so that rather than saying “Ukraine hasn’t yet died, nor has her glory or freedom,” it now says that it’s Ukraine’s glory and freedom which haven’t perished. Also, the current version of the anthem is limited to the first verse of Chubynskyi’s poem (with the modification to the first line mentioned above) plus the chorus, which was the first half of Chubynskyi’s original chorus; previously, three verses and a chorus were commonly used.

		<string>Before independence in 1962, a committee was formed to choose Uganda’s national symbols.  A contest was held to determine the national anthem; the criterion for the entrants was that the compositions had to be “short, original, solemn, praising and looking forward to the future.”  Despite having recieved several compositions, none were deemed suitable.  The head of the committee then asked George Kakoma, a graduate of Trinity College of Music and Durham University in London, to compose an anthem.  Kakoma came up with the anthem within a day and it was declared the winner in July of that year, a few months before independence; the short length of the work (it is only nine measures in length, one of the shortest national anthems in the world) was one of the biggest advantages it had in being selected.

		<string>During the war of 1812 (on September 14, 1814), poet Francis Scott Key wrote a poem entitled “Defense of Fort McHenry”, being inspired by seeing the American flag still flying amidst the battle. Key never meant for it to become a song, or a national anthem, yet after showing the poem to his brother in law Judge Joseph H Nicholson, Nicholson noticed the poem could fit the tune “The Anacreontic Song” (also known as “To Anacraeon in Heaven”), a song originally written for a gentlemen’s social club in London, but gained popularity outside Great Britain, including in the United States, where by this time the tune was familiar to American ears. Key may have had this tune in mind when he wrote the poem; an earlier poem of his called “When the Warrior Returns” was also in the same rhythym, could be set to the same tune, and is of similar subject matter – the last two lines of each stanza of that poem also end with “wave” and “brave”.

The poem spread quickly across the United States, the first printing of the poem in a Baltimore paper suggested the “Anacraeon in Heaven” tune, and it stuck. A Baltimore music store owner first printed the song under the title “The Star Spangled Banner.” It gained in popularity, and was made the official tune to accompany flag raisings by the secretary of the Navy in 1889. In 1916 it was ordered to be played at military and other occassions, and, due to a large public relations effort, it was officially adopted by Congress as the first official national anthem of the United States in 1931. There are four verses to the anthem, but it is the first verse that is almost always sung.  (Interestingly, the first verse is a question, only answered by the other three verses).

In addition to countless patriotic songs, there are also state songs for each of the fifty states as well.  Also, the song “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” is considered an unofficial anthem by the African-American community, and is often used by African-American organizations and at events for the African-American community.

1. Oh, say can you see by the dawn’s early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thru the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

2. On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
‘Tis the star-spangled banner!  Oh long may it wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

3. And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out of their foul footsteps’ pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

4. Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war’s desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: “In God is our trust.”
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

		<string>After Uruguay’s independence in 1828 without a national anthem, the poet Francisco Esteban Acuña de Figueroa offered to write one for the government, and it was accepted as a draft anthem in 1830 and officially approved by the government three years later.  However, like many anthems of the era at the time, it had violent diatribes against Spain (the colonial power over Uruguay) and Portugal and Brazil (Uruguay’s neighbour who annexed the area after a revolt against Spain).  The final version debuted in 1845.  Acuña de Figueroa’s text had 11 verses, but today only the first verse and the chorus is sung.

The music, typical for a Latin American epic anthem is operatic in nature, reminiscent of works by Italian composers Donizetti, Verdi, Bellini or Rossini, but the music was composed by Francisco José Debali, a Hungarian who had moved to Uruguay in 1838 after having served as a military band master in the Piedmont area of Italy.  Acuña de Figueroa’s words were first set to a piece of music by a composer named de Barros, but in 1848 it was set to Debali’s work.  The extended grandeur of the music makes it run very long, even though only one verse is performed today; at 105 bars and almost five minutes in length (if the musical introduction is included), Uruguay’s anthem is the longest in the world.

		<string>The “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is the first official anthem of the Vatican after a work known as the “Gran Marcia Trionfale” [Great Triumphal March] by Vittorino Hallmayr, the bandmaster of an Austrian regiment located in Rome, was used on an unofficial basis.  The “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is performed in the presence of: the Pope; one of his special legates; or on occasion of presentation of Credential Letters by a papal nuncio. The music by noted composer Charles-François Gounod was written in 1857 for the jubille anniversary of pope Pius IX. Originally, the anthem had Italian lyrics, Latin lyrics were created later (and slightly modified in 1993) as a way for Catholics around the world to sing it in a common language, and the Italian lyrics are no longer used.  The Latin lyrics were by a Catholic priest, who took inspiration from scripture passages about St. Peter (the first Pope in Catholic tradition).  According to the Vatican, the “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is not to be understood as a national anthem, but rather as a hymn that speaks to Roman Catholics worldwide; in practice, however, it serves as the anthem for the Vatican State.

		<string>Inspired by the first attempt of the Venezuelans to win their independence in 1810, members of the Patriotic Society in the capital Caracas decided to create a patriotic song to encourage the people in their revolution against Spain. While Venezuelan independence was declared in 1811, both the composer and lyricist of the anthem, still fighting in the revolution, were executed by a Spanish firing squad in 1814.

Different from most other anthems of the area (known in this site as “Latin American epic anthems“), the Venezuelan anthem has been known as the “Venezuelan Marseillaise“, possibly due to its origins.</string>

		<string>At the time that South Africa’s multi-racial system of government was adopted, there were two anthems in use among the people, divided by the old racial lines. “N’kosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” (God Bless Africa), written and composed by Enoch Mankayi, was popular with the black population and was used as an anti-Apartheid anthem.  The white South Africans had been using “Die Stem van Suid Afrika” (The Call of South Africa) since the 1920s on an unofficial basis, and was made the country’s official anthem in 1957. Even though the latter anthem was seen as too closely tied to the apartheid system by the majority black population, it was decided in the interim to make both anthems the national anthem, “God Bless Africa” was usually played in its entirety followed by the complete “Die Stem”.

In 1997, the two anthems were combined, and the lyrics reflect South Africa’s multi-racial status in that the lyrics employ five of the most popularly spoken of South Africa’s eleven official languages.  The lyrics start with a few lines of “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” in Xhosa, then Zulu, followed by Sesotho, then a few lines of “Die Stem” in Afrikaans, and finishing the anthem with another few lines from “The Call of South Africa” in English. (The English lines actually do not appear in the official English version of “Die Stem”, but are an abridgement of the last few lines of the first verse, with the words slightly altered to reflect South Africa’s new freedom).

The national anthem of South Africa is unique in a couple of aspects: first of all, as mentioned above, the anthem employs five different languages in the same version of the official lyrics, secondly, by virtue of the fact that it combines two disparate pieces of music, this anthem as well as Italy’s and that of the Philippines are the only ones that end on a different key than they begins with.

		<string>Upon independence in 1964, Zambia adopted the melody of “God Bless Africa” for the melody, yet different lyrics were written to specifically reflect Zambia. “God Bless Africa” is a popular song and anthem in southern Africa, the song was also formerly used by Zimbabwe, Ciskei, and Transkei, and currently by Tanzania and as part of the South African anthem.

In 2005, representatives of the Zambian women’s movement wanted the lyrics to the national anthem changed: “free men” changed to “freely” and “brothers” to “all one”.  It was decreed that when the anthem was adopted the masculine gender was used to include females as well, and the anthem was not changed, since the anthem is “composed of historical lyrics that reflect the country’s heritage.”

		<string>In 1994, a contest was held for a uniquely Zimbabwean anthem (the anthem then used, “God Bless Africa” was used by at least half a dozen former and current nations and groups in southern Africa). The winning entry was entitled “Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe” in the Ndebele language, “Simudzai Mureza WeZimbabwe” in Shona, and “Blessed Be The Land of Zimbabwe” in English, and had lyrics written for the anthem in all three of the main languages of the country by a leading Zimbabwean poet and academic.

The symbol of freedom proclaiming victory;
We praise our heroes’ sacrifice,
And vow to keep our land from foes;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
 
2. O lovely Zimbabwe, so wondrously adorned
With mountains, and rivers cascading, flowing free;
May rain abound, and fertile fields;
May we be fed, our labour blessed;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
 
3. O God, we beseech Thee to bless our native land;
The land of our fathers bestowed upon us all;
From Zambezi to Limpopo
May leaders be exemplary;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
