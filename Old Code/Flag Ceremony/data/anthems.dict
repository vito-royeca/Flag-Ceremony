		<string>The flag of the tiny country Andorra, which is situated in the mountains between France and Spain, was adopted in 1866. Andorra was jointly managed for many years by Spain and France. The cooperation was cancelled in 1993, when the country gained independence and became a modern parliamentary democracy. The flag is composed of a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow, and red stripe and a yellow coat of arms in the middle of the yellow stripe. One half of the coat of arms refers to the ties with Spain, whereas the second points to relations to France. Miter and crutches in the upper left quarter of the coat of arms are sign of Spanish bishop and two red cows at the bottom right should commemorate the French province of Bearn.</string>

		<string>“El Gran Carlemany” presents the nation’s history in a first-person narrative. The anthem was officially adopted on September 8, 1921, the anniversary date of the feast of Our Lady of Meritxell (the Virgin Mary), the patron saint of Andorra. 

Despite the anthem having been written just before the official change in Catalan orthography, the lyrics using the old orthography are still official in Andorra and in active use.

El gran Carlemany, mon Pare dels alarbs me deslliurà,
I del cel vida em donà de Meritxell, la gran Mare,
Princesa nasquí i Pubilla entre dos nacions neutral
Sols resto lúnica filla de l’imperi Carlemany.
Creient i lluire onze segles, creient i lliure vull ser.
¡Siguin els furs mos tutors i mos Prínceps defensors!

The great Charlemagne, my Father, liberated me from the Saracens,
And from heaven he gave me life of Meritxell the great Mother.
I was born a Princess, a Maiden neutral between two nations.
I am the only remaining daughter of the Carolingian empire
Believing and free for eleven centuries, believing and free I will be.
The laws of the land be my tutors, and my defender Princes!
And Princes my defender!

		<string>The current flag of Afghanistan has been used since 2004, when the Taliban regime was removed. Since gaining the independence in 1919, the flag has undergone many changes in relation to political events. The current form of the flag is inspired by the flag that was used during the monarchy and differs only in the national emblem in the middle of the flag. Currently, it consists of a vertical tricolor of black, red, and green and national emblem in the middle of the red stripe. The colors could be  interpreted as follows: black represents the former Abbasid caliphate, red royal dignity, and green is the traditional color of Islam. Yellow national emblem consists of a mihrab (a niche in a mosque) and minbar (pulpit) placed in a wreath bearing an inscription "God is great".</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In 2004, the new Afghan constitution stated that a new national anthem for the country, requested by the post-Taliban government to signal a new era for Afghanistan, must be written in Pashto and contain the phrase “Allahu Akbar” (God is Great), and mention the names of the ethnic groups in Afghanistan. The winning composition was created by two Afghans living outside the country due to the war.

There has been some criticism of the anthem due to the above stated conditions of composition, that the Pashto requirement places less importance on the other languages spoken in the country; that the phrase “Allahu Akbar” should not be used in the anthem, as it is a sacred phrase in Islam and should not be set to music; and the ethnic groups mentioned in the anthem still do not represent the entire spectrum of nationalities in the country.</string>

		<string>The flag of Antigua and Barbuda was adopted in 1967 when these two islands in the Caribbean Sea became independent. The design of the flag was created by Antiguan teacher Reginald Samuels. The flag should refer to the past but also to better prospects for the future. The rising sun represents new era, two red triangles on the sides represent the energy of the local population and the black represents its African-American origins. Blue stands for hope and the gradual use of the tricolor of yellow, blue, and white evokes the sun, sea, and sand. Naval flag consists of a red St. George's cross on a white background and the national flag in the upper left corner.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Upon achieving statehood in the commonwealth in 1967, Antigua adopted the anthem “Fair Antigua, We Salute Thee”, which has the same melody as the current anthem however with somewhat different lyrics. When full independence was granted in 1981, Antigua, now linked with Barbuda,  adopted the current lyrics with the melody in use since 1967.  As a constitutional monarchy, Antigua and Barbuda has God Save the Queen as their royal anthem.</string>

Answer now to duty’s call
To the service of thy country,
Sparing nothing, giving all;
Gird your loins and join the battle
‘Gainst fear, hate and poverty,
Each endeavouring, all achieving,
Live in peace where man is free.

Rain and sunshine ever sending,
Fill her fields with crops and flowers;
We her children do implore Thee,
Give us strength, faith, loyalty,
Never failing, all enduring

		<string>Albanian flag consists of a red leaf where a black double-headed eagle is depicted. The flag was adopted in 1912, when Albania gained independence from the Ottoman Empire. The origin of the flag is associated with a national hero Skanderbeger (formerly George Kastrioti), who lived in the fifteenth century and who was a general of the Turkish army. However, Skanderbeger left the army so that he can return to Albania and erect the flag with double-headed egle above the castle of his father in Kruje with words: "I did not bring you freedom. I found it here, among you." After his return to Albania, Skanderbeger managed to unify Albania and defend it against the Turkish attacks.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Back when Albania first gained independence as a monarchy in 1912 from Italy, “Hymni i Flamurit” was adopted, and has been kept as the anthem through its period as a Communist/Marxist state and now as a democratic nation. The original title of the hymn was “Betimi mi flamur,” or “Pledge to the Flag.” The hymn was first published as a poem in Liri e Shqipërisë (Freedom of Albania), an Albanian newspaper in Sofia, Bulgaria, in its issue of 21 April 1912. Later that year it appeared in a volume of collected poems by Drenova, under the title “Ëndra e lot” (Dreams and Tears), which was published in Bucharest. The official anthem uses only the first two stanzas of the original poem (the second stanza is used as a chorus). The music was composed by the same person (a Romanian) who wrote the Romanian anthem in use from 1977-1990.</string>

		<string>The flag of Armenia, which has been adopted in 1990, consists of three horizontal stripes - red, dark blue, and mustard yellow one. It differs from the flag that had been used until 1920 only by the aspect ratio. Allegedly, the red color represents the blood shed by Armenian soldiers, blue stands for the sky and hope and orange represents the fertile land and Armenian population. Armenia has been the first Christian state, this religion has been adopted in the 4th century. Historically, Armenia was part of several groupings - firstly it was Roman, Byzantine and later Arabic, Persian and Ottoman Empire. The last intervention to the autonomy of the state was an annexation by the Soviet Union in the 20th century.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The words to “Mer Hayrenik”, taken from a poem by Mikael Nalbandian, were set to music long before Armenia adopted it as her anthem upon regaining her independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The present anthem is a modified version of a poem called “Song of an Italian Girl”, which consisted of six stanzas. Some of the words have also been changed appropriately to reflect the freedom and independence of the country. The anthem melody was found to date from the 19th century in what is now Istanbul, Turkey as a vocal exercise for singers. 

In 2006, a search was sent out for a new national anthem, as the criticisms against “Mer Hayrenik” was that it was only meant as a temporary anthem, was not composed by an Armenian, and does not reflect modern Armenia. One of the proposed candidates is the melody (but not the lyrics) of the anthem of Soviet Armenia.

		<string>The background of Angolan flag, which was adopted in 1975, consists of two horizontal stripes of red and black color of the same width. Red should symbolize the blood shed during the struggle for freedom and black stands for African continent and the black population. The central motif is located at the borderline of these stripes and consists of a yellow five-pointed star surrounded by half of toothed wheel which is cut by machete. At first glance, these symbols evoke the traditional symbols of communism - the star represents socialism, the wheel industry, and the machete stands for the rural population and agriculture. The yellow color of this theme should point to the vast mineral wealth of the country. In 2003, a new flag was designed, but it has not found support among Angolans yet.</string>

		<string>start scotland and marquesDuring Portuguese rule, starting in 1961, Angola had an unofficial local anthem, entitled “Angola é nossa” (“Angola is ours”), used as a march by the Portuguese troops in Angola, it was not performed after independence negotiations were started in 1974,end scotland and marques and a different anthem, “Angola Avante” was adopted upon independence from Portugal.

There has been a commission appointed to study any possible changes needed in Angola’s national symbols (there are references in the national anthem to important dates and events for the previous sole ruling party, made obsolete after multi-party elections were declared). The anthem may change in the future, watch this page for further information.

		<string>The flag of Argentine is strikingly similar to the flag of Uruguay, especially by its blue-and-white design and yellow symbol of sun, which represents the Inca god of sun called Inti. The white stripe is surrounded by two pale blue stripes and a symbol of the sun is located in its middle. The flag was probably designed in 1812 by general Manuel Belgrano, the Argentine patriot that strongly opposed to Spanish domination. The general was allegedly inspired by the Argentine blue sky above the battlefield, or perhaps by the blue military cockades of his soldiers. Still, there are doubts whether he really was the author of the flag.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In 1812, Vicente López attended a play about the revolution that brought the country independence two years earlier, the play concluded with an anthem sung by the actors. López was inspired to write a proper anthem for the nation instead of the one presented in the play, and it was approved by the government. The composer of the music used in the play, Blas Parera, was asked to compose the music for the anthem despite Parera’s objections due to the anti-Spanish lyrics and himself being a Spaniard. The stately nature of the music, combined with its long length, make it similar in style to other anthems of the area, a group of anthems I term “Latin American epic anthems”.

The anthem also has had many titles; originally called the “Anthem of May” by López, it was then christened the “Marcha Patriótica” (Patriotic March) by the government on its adoption on May 11, 1813 (the third anniversary of the revolution) and was later known as “Canción Patriótica Nacional” (National Patriotic Song). An 1847 copy titles it “Himno Nacional Argentino”, which is the name it is known by today.

In the following years, the anthem underwent many modifications to tone down the militaristic and anti-Spanish nature of the song. In a presidential decree in 1900, it was declared that the first and last verses of the anthem as adopted on March 11, 1813 (rather than the full original nine verses), would be the official anthem, which remains to this day.</string>

Oíd el ruido de rotas cadenas,
ved en trono a la noble igualdad.
Ya su trono dignísimo abrieron
las Provincias Unidas del Sud
y los libres del mundo responden:
“Al gran pueblo argentino, ¡Salud!”
“Al gran pueblo argentino, ¡Salud!”
Y los libres del mundo responden:
“Al gran pueblo argentino, ¡Salud!”
Y los libres del mundo responden:
“Al gran pueblo argentino, ¡Salud!”

CHORUS:
Sean eternos los laureles
que supimos conseguir,
que supimos conseguir.
Coronados de gloria vivamos…
¡o juremos con gloria morir!,
¡o juremos con gloria morir!,
¡o juremos con gloria morir!

Or let us swear in glory to die!
Or let us swear in glory to die!

		<string>The Austrian flag is considered to be one of the oldest flags. It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width, where the middle one is white and the other two are red. According to the legend, the Babenberg Duke Leopold V. fought in the Crusade for the Holy Land in 1191 at the Battle of Acre so valiantly, that he did not even notice that his white shirt is totally covered in blood. After the battle he realized that he had lost his standard, so he decided to hang his stained shirt instead. When he took off his belt with scabbard, untouched white stripe appeared on his shirt. In the 13th century, the last Babenberg Duke adopted red and white as his colors in order to express admiration and respect to his valiant predecessor.</string>

		<string>On 9 April 1946, the Austrian Federal Government announced a competition for the text of a new national anthem. It was to be “a song of hymn-like character paying tribute in words and music to the new Austrian federal state and its people both at home and abroad.” The old anthem melody, now being used by Germany, could not be used because of its association with the Nazi regime. 

Agreement was soon reached on the melody; popular belief is that it is a work from Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but studies have shown this may not be the case. While the piece appears in Mozart’s “Kleiner Freimaurer-Kantate”, written in 1791 for the Freemason lodge “Zur neu gekronten Hoffnung” in Vienna, in which Mozart himself was a member, the original score of the work, which is kept by the Vienna Society of Friends of the Music, does not include the melody used as the anthem. But when the lodge published a printed version a year later, the melody appears in the appendix, entitled “Zum Schluss der Loge” (“On the end of lodge’), that is, it should be sung on the end of a gathering, beginning with the words “Bruder, reicht die Hand zum Bunde” (“Brothers, give your hands for union”). In this version, it was frequently used by choral societies and student’s fraternities in Germany and Austria in the 19th century, and became known as “Bundeslied” (Union Song).  The appendixed melody thus hasn’t been proven or disproven to be written by Mozart, several scholars claim it could have been written by Mozart’s contemporary (and fellow lodge member) Johann Holzer. 

Paula von Preradović, the granddaughter of a Croatian national poet – was persuaded by Minister of Education Felix Hurdes to submit an entry for the competition. However, she was busy working on a new novel, had little time to spare for her entry, and Minister Hurdes had to jog her memory several times. When her lines did finally reach the jury – made up of literary figures, musicians and politicians – they awarded her text the highest points. The text was never published in the official Legal Gazette but appeared in the 22 March 1947 issue of the Die Presse newspaper. Two weeks earlier the anthem had been played on the radio. It established its popularity relatively fast, although the melody was considerably more complex than that of the former anthem. When Minister Hurdes reported to the cabinet on the outcome of the competition, the cabinet passed a motion – at the instigation of the Federal President – that in the course of the State Treaty negotiations Austria should insist that “Germany be prohibited from using the Haydn anthem because it is a long-standing Austrian cultural asset.”

 Alexander Krischnig: 

In the early 21st century, there was a proposal by Austria’s Minister of Women’s Affairs to change the lyrics of the anthem (eliminating words and phrases like “home of great sons”, “fraternal”, and “Vaterland” (“Fatherland”)) to make them more gender-inclusive); amid much controversy, a proposal was passed to change the lyrics beginning January 1, 2012, the first verse now references sons and daughters instead of just sons (“Heimat bist du grosser Söhne”) and the third verse now references “jubilant choirs” instead of “fraternal choirs” (“Brüderchören”)

		<string>The Australian flag was adopted in 1909 and its design reflects historical ties to the Great Britain. As in the case of the British flag, the background is blue, but the Union Jack flag is reduced and placed at the top of the left side. Below the Union Jack, there is a seven-pointed star, whose six tips represent Australian states and the seventh tip refers to two independent federal territories. On the right half of the flag, the constellation of the Southern Cross, which dominates the Australian sky, stretches. Indigenous Australians have their own flag. Via red and black stripes and yellow disc, their flag is trying to represent the indigenous tribes, the earth and the sun.</string>

		<string>A prolific composer, Scottish-born Peter Dodds McCormick was moved to compose a national anthem for Australia when, having attended a concert of the world’s anthems, there was no anthem for Australia.  His original lyrics heavily emphasized Australia’s ties to Britain (as Australia was a British colony at the time).  Upon Australia’s inauguration as a separate Commonwealth on January 1, 1901, the song was performed, but the British “God Save the Queen” was still the official anthem of Australia.  At this time, the third verse of McCormick’s original work was changed.

While “Advance Australia Fair” remained popular with the people in the decades following, no official national anthem other than “God Save the Queen” was declared.  In 1974 the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a national opinion poll of 60,000 and in 1977 a plebiscite for a national song was conducted. On each occasion, Advance Australia Fair was the preferred option (the other choices were the existing anthem “God Save the Queen” and the popular national songs “Song of Australia” and “Waltzing Mathilda”), and it was in consideration of such support that Advance Australia Fair was proclaimed as the national anthem by the Governor-General on 19 April 1984. From the original five-verse song, only the first and third verses are the official national anthem, with slight changes to make the song more gender-inclusive.  The Governor-General of Australia (as the representative of the monarch) is greeted with an abbreviated version of the anthem consisting of the first four bars followed by the last four bars.  (The Queen, as monarch of Australia, continues to use her royal anthem “God Save the Queen”.)

		<string>The flag of Azerbaijan consists of three horizontal stripes - the top one is blue, the middle one is red, and the bottom one is green. In the middle of the red stripe, a white crescent and eight-pointed star are placed. Star, crescent, and green color are the traditional symbols of Islam. Eight peaks of the star denote eight Turkic groups inhabiting Azerbaijan and the crescent was borrowed from the Turkish flag. The symbolism of the colors is as follows: blue stripe represents the unity of Turkic groups, red is a symbol of progress and struggle for freedom, and the green stripe refers to the Muslim religion. The flag was officially adopted in 1918, but it was banned during the Soviet rule, and it has not been readopted until gaining the independence in 1991.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>First adopted as Azerbaijan’s anthem in 1919, a contest for a new national anthem was declared the following year, but a Russian invasion, ending Azerbaijan’s brief independence, ended that.  On May 27, 1992, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the “Azerbaijan Marsi,” was re-adopted as the anthem of Azerbaijan.  The composer of the anthem was the same person that composed the music to the anthem used by the Azerbaijan SSR.

		<string>The flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina has a very unusual shape. The right part of the flag is made up of vertical blue stripe and the central part is specific by a yellow triangle whose hypotenuse carries seven full and two half white five-pointed stars. The left part is filled with blue color. The blue color together with white stars should refer to the membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Council of Europe. The peaks of the triangle represent three nations - Croats, Serbs, and Bosnians. Blue, white, and yellow color are traditionally associated with peace and neutrality. The flag in its current form was adopted in 1998. Shortly after the declaration of independence from Yugoslavia, a white flag with the coat of arms of Tvrtko Kotromanic from 14th century was used.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>As an inclusionist measure, a new anthem was adopted for Bosnia and Hercegovina on June 25, 1999.  It was originally without words until the lyrics could be written and agreed upon; the music itself was written under the title “Intermecco”, but the anthem is titled “Državna himna Bosne i Hercegovine” (The National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina).

Nearly ten years later, in February, 2009, lyrics written by the composer of the piece, Dušan Šestić, along with Benjamin Isović, were accepted by a parliamentary commission, yet await official adoption by all levels of government, so the anthem still remains officially without words.  While the lyrics don’t mention the different ethnicities or the two administrative areas of Bosnia (the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which uses the national anthem, and Srpska, which uses their own anthem), the anthem concludes with “We go into the future, together”.

The anthem doesn’t seem to be all that popular in Bosnia, the various nationalities tending to use their own anthems (Serbia‘s by the Bosnian Serbs, Croatia‘s by Bosnian Croats, and the former anthem “Jedna si Jedina” by the Bosnian Muslims.)

		<string>Barbados was settled in the 17th century by the British, who founded sugar plantations cultivated by imported black slave population on the island. Sugarcane remained the main commodity even after the abolition of slavery in 1834. Extensive reforms did not take place until the 20th century and the island gained independence from Britain in 1960. And it is this moment that should be symbolized by the black trident separated from the shaft as a central theme of Barbadian flag, which was adopted in 1966. In colonial times, the flag bore a whole trident. Each peak of the trident reminds one democratic principle, two blue vertical stripes represent the sea and the sky, and the middle yellow stripe represents the sand.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The Barbados national anthem was adopted upon independence on November 30, 1966. The lyrics were written by Mr. Irving Burgie, a USC music scholar who also performed music under the name Lord Burgess, and was a songwriter for Harry Belafonte.  Not a Barbadian, Mr. Burgie happened to be on holiday to the island when he was asked to compose an anthem for the country.

The selection of the music was charged to a committee, who selected the work of Mr. C. Van Roland Edwards, whow as awarded $500 for his efforts.  Mr. Edwards had no formal music training and was also partly blind. Because of his partial blindness he was assisted in his work by his two daughters Nannette and Eullia. 

As a constitutional monarchy with the British royal family as its head of state, the British royal anthem serves as Barbados’ royal anthem as well.

When this fair land was young
Our brave forefathers sowed the seed
From which our pride is sprung,
A pride that makes no wanton boast
Of what it has withstood
That binds our hearts from coast to coast – 
The pride of nationhood.

We loyal sons and daughters all
Do hereby make it known
These fields and hills beyond recall
Are now our very own.
We write our names on history’s page
With expectations great,
Strict guardians of our heritage,
Firm craftsmen of our fate. 

2. The Lord has been the people’s guide
For past three hundred years.
With him still on the people’s side
We have no doubts or fears.
Upward and onward we shall go,
Inspired, exulting, free,
And greater will our nation grow
In strength and unity.

		<string>The flag of Bangladesh was adopted on 17th January 1972 and it is very similar to the Japanese flag (except for the green background). Originally, a flag with a golden map of the country was used, however this design was abandoned for the reasons of simplification. Thus, the flag is made up of a green leaf with a red circle. However, the circle is not placed exactly in the center of the flag, but it is shifted slightly to the left, which creates an illusion that the circle is actually located in the middle when the flag is raised. The circle stands for the beginning of independence or for the sun rising over the Bay of Bengal. The green background symbolizes the local fertile landscape and also it is also a traditional color of Islam.</string>

In autumn, O mother mine, in the full blossomed paddy fields I have seen spread all over sweet smiles.
Ah, what beauty, what shades, what an affection, and what tenderness!
What a quilt have you spread at the feet of banyan trees and along the banks of rivers!

		<key>flagInfo</key>
		<string>The Belgian flag, which was inspired by the French tricolor, was adopted in 1831, shortly after gaining independence from the Netherlands. Originally, the stripes were horizontal, but Belgians eventually inclined to the version with vertical stripes in order to differ from the Dutch flag. The black, yellow and red colors are characteristic of Brabant province - Brabant rebels wore these colors during the uprising against Austria in the late 18th century. For the second time, the tricolor appeared during the uprising against William I of the Netherlands. This riot, unlike the previous one, was successful, that is why the flag evokes the struggle for independence and freedom.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The Belgium anthem had its genesis when Belgium gained its independence in 1830. The popular legend goes that it was written by some young people in a cafe on Fource St. in Brussels in September 1830. While the story may or may not be true, the anthem does date back to that time. In 1860, the anti-Dutch lyrics were softened and the version that is in use today was created. When Deceht (better known as “Jenneval”) wrote his verses, he called the poem ‘La Bruxelloise’. His publisher thought it better to broaden the scope from the city’s to the area’s name (Brabant) and renamed it “La Brabançonne”. 

The music was written in September of 1830 and the first public performance of the anthem occurred the following month. Finally, in 1921, it was decreed that only the fourth stanza of the 1860 lyrics are official in the French and Dutch versions, although I understand that all the verses are commonly used and sung. However, an official version of the “Brabançonne” does not actually exist. Different commissions have been established to examine the words and melody of the song and establish an official version. Yet, all of their efforts had been in vain.

There are also anthems of the Flanders and Wallonia areas within Belgium.

		<string>The flag of Burkina Faso consists of two horizontal stripes in red and green colors and a golden star located in the center of the flag on the borderline of these stripes. The colors used are typical examples of pan-African colors, however, the official explanation says that the red symbolizes the socialist revolution and that the green color stands for natural wealth of the country. Burkina Faso was a French colony until 1960 and it was called Upper Volta. The flag has been adopted in 1984 when the country was renamed to Burkina Faso (in translation "a country of unbribables") after the series of military coups. The colors also refer to solidarity towards other African nations and the golden star recalls the guiding light of the revolution.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Also called “Une Seule Nuit” (One Single Night), Burkina Faso’s anthem, entitled “Le Ditanye” according to the constitution, was adopted when the country changed its name from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso in 1984.

 The author was the president of the country at the time of its renaming. Sankara was an enthusiastic guitarist (he played in a band named “Tout-à-Coup Jazz”) and he was also famous for his charismatic speeches and political poems; therefore it seems to be credible that he really wrote the text (and possibly the music) of the anthem, and his name not just mentioned for propaganda reasons.</string>

1. Contre la férule humiliante il y a déjà mille ans,
La rapacité venue de loin les asservir il y a cent ans.
Contre la cynique malice métamorphosée
En néocolonialisme et ses petits servants locaux
Beaucoup flanchèrent et certains résistèrent.
Mais les échecs, les succès, la sueur, le sang
Ont fortifié notre peuple courageux et fertilisé sa lutte héroïque. 

CHORUS:  
Et une seule nuit a rassemblée en elle
L’histoire de tout un peuple.
Et une seule nuit a déclenché sa marche triomphale
Vers l’horizon du bonheur.
Une seule nuit a réconcilié notre peuple
Avec tous les peuples du monde,
A la conquête de la liberté et du progrès
La patrie ou la mort, nous vaincrons.

2. Nourris à la source vive de la Révolution.
Les engagés volontaires de la liberté et de la paix
Dans l’énergie nocturne et salutaire du 4 août
N’avaient pas que les armes à la main, mais aussi et surtout
La flamme au coeur pour legitimement libérer
Le Faso à jamais des fers de tous ceux qui
Çà et là en poluaient l’âme sacrée de l’indépendance, de la souveraineté. 
Chorus

3. Et séant désormais en sa dignité recouvrée
L’amour et l’honneur en partage avec l’humanité,
Le peuple du Burkina chante un hymne à la victoire,
A la gloire du travail libérateur, émancipateur.
A bas l’explotation de l’homme par l’homme!
Hé en avant pour le bonheur de tout homme,
Par tous les hommes aujourd’hui et demain, par tous les hommes ici et pour toujours!
Chorus

4. Révolution populaire notre sève nourricière.
Maternité immortelle du progrès à visage d’homme.
Foyer éternel de démocratie consensuelle,
Où enfin l’identité nationale a droit de cité,
Où pour toujours l’injustice perd ses quartiers,
Et où, des mains des bâtisseurs d’un monde radieux
Mûrissent partout les moissons de væux patriotiques, brillent les soleils infins de joie.

1. Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years
Rapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years.
Against the cynical malice in the shape
Of neo-colonialism and its petty local servants.
Many gave in and certain others resisted.
But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the blood
Have fortified our courageous people and fertilized its heroic struggle. 
 
CHORUS:  
And one single night has drawn together
The history of an entire people,
And one single night has launched its triumphal march.
Towards the horizon of good fortune.
One single night has brought together our people
With all the peoples of the World,
In the acquisition of liberty and progress.
Motherland or death, we shall conquer.

2. Nourished in the lively source of the Revolution,
The volunteers for liberty and peace
With their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the 4 of August
Had not only hand arms, but also and above all
The flame in their hearts lawfully to free
Faso forever from the fetters of those who
Here and there were polluting the sacred soul of independence and sovereignty. 
Chorus

3. And seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity,
Love and honour partnered with humanity,
The people of Burkina sing a victory hymn
To the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation.
Down with exploitation of man by man!
Forward for the good of every man
By all men of today and tomorrow, by every man here and always!
Chorus

4. Popular revolution our nourishing sap.
Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man.
Eternal hearth of agreed democracy,
Where at last national identity has the right of freedom.
Where injustice has lost its place forever,
And where from the hands of builders of a glorious world
Everywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen and suns of boundless joy shine.
Chorus

		<string>The Bulgarian flag, which was adopted in 1991, is made up of tricolor of horizontal stripes of white, green, and red color. Originally, it was very similar to the Russian flag since it had the typical Pan-Slavic colors, however, the blue stripe has been replaced by a green one in 1878, so that it better reflects the agricultural character of the country. White stripe represents peace, green fertility of the soil and the red one stands for courage of the Bulgarians. Until 1990, the upper left part held an emblem with lion surrounded by wheat spikes, which were tied with a red ribbon with inscriptions 681 and 1944. In 681, the state was founded and in 1944, it was liberated from the Nazis. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the coat of arms was removed, and only three colored stripes remained.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Originally written and composed by a Bulgarian student in 1885, as he went off to fight in the Serbo-Bulgarian war, the song was titled “Горда Стара планина” (“Gorda Stara planina”) [Proudly Rise the Balkan Peaks].  The original lyrics have undergone revisions since its original composition, the latest after the fall of the communist government in 1990 where verses not in the original lyrics speaking of friendship with Russia, the Communist Party, and fallen fighters were removed.  As the national anthem its name comes from the first line of the chorus rather than the first line of the verse.

		<string>The flag of Bahrain is composed of red and white stripe, which are separated by a zigzag line consisting of five triangles. Originally, the flag bore more than five triangles, but their number was reduced to five in 2002, so that they can symbolize five pillars of Islam. Red is the traditional color of the Gulf countries. White stripe has been added on the flag in 1820 after the creation of naval pact with the Great Britain, which inter alia stated an obligation to identify all ships of the pact by a flag with a white stripe. The flag in its current form has been adopted in 1932 and it is often confused with the flag of Qatar, although it has more "teeth" and its shape is more elongated compared to the flag of Bahrain.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Upon independence in 1971, Bahrain adopted the anthem “Bahrainona.” It is in the “Arab fanfare” style of anthem. The original lyrics by Mohamed Sudqi Ayyash were changed in 2002 when the country became a kingdom and the ruler became a king rather than an Emir.</string>

		<string>Unusual flag of Burundi has been adopted on March 28, 1967. Its central theme is a white cross and a white circle in the middle of the flag. The cross divides the flag into four parts, where the upper and the lower fields are red and the left and the right field are green. In the white circle, there are three six-pointed stars, which allegedly represent national motto: "Unity, work, and progress." The stars may also symbolize the three main ethnical groups of Burundi, which are Hutus, Tutsis and Pygmies. Green color indicates hope for better future, while red traditionally recalls the blood shed during the struggle for freedom. The white color of the cross symbolizes peace.</string>

Lifting yourself proudly into the ranks of free peoples.
Receive, then, the congratulations of the nations
And the homage of your sons.

Recognized as worthy of self-government,
With your courage you also have a sense of honour.
Sing the glory of liberty conquered again. 

Beloved Burundi, worthy of our tenderest love,
We vow to your noble service our hands and hearts and lives.
May God, who gave you to us, keep you for us to venerate,
Under the shield of unity,

		<string>The current flag of Benin has been adopted for the first time in 1960, when the country achieved independence from France. The flag consists of three stripes - two horizontal ones in yellow and red colors and one vertical green on the left side of the flag. These colors are traditional Pan-African colors, where green represents hope, yellow symbolizes wealth and red stands for courage and the bloodshed during the struggles for independence. These colors emphasize the solidarity with the other African nations. In 1975, Marxist government came to power in Benin and the country was renamed to the Republic of Dahomey. In these times, a green flag with a red star in the upper left corner was used. After the fall of the regime in 1990, the previous flag has been readopted.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The national anthem was adopted upon independence as Dahomey in 1960. When the country was renamed to Benin in 1975, the anthem was retained (with the name of the country and its citizens changing appropriately), although the new two-syllable name had to fit the three-syllable space in the melody.

La liberté d’un cri sonore
Chante aux premiers feux de l’aurore;
Enfants du Bénin debout!

1. Jadis à son appel, nos aieux sans faiblesse
Ont su avec courage, ardeur pleins d’allegresse
Livrer au prix du sang des combats éclatants.
Accourez vous aussi, bâtisseurs du présent,
Plus forts dans l’unité, chaqu’jour a la tache,
Pour la prosperité, construisez sans relâche.

Chorus

2. Quand partout souffle un vent de clère et de haine,
Béninois, sois fier, et d’une âme sereine,
Confiant dans l’avenir, regarde ton drapeau!
Dans le vert tu liras l’espoir du renouveau,
De tes aïeux le rouge évoque le courage;
Des plus riches trésors le jaune est le présage.

Chorus

3. Tes monts ensoleillés, tes palmiers, ta verdure,
Cher Bénin, partout font ta vive parure.
Ton sol offre à chacun la richesse des fruits.
Bénin, désormais que tes fils tous unis
D’un fraternel élan partagent l’espérance
De te voir à jamais heureux dans l’abondance.

Children of Benin, arise!
The resounding cry of freedom
Is heard at the first light of dawn;
Children of Benin, arise!

1. Formerly, at her call, our ancestors
Knew how to engage in mighty battles
With strength, courage, ardour, and full of joy, but at the price of blood.
Builders of the present, you too, join forces
Each day for the task stronger in unity.
Build without ceasing for posterity.

Chorus

2. When all around there blows a wind of anger and hate:
Citizen of Benin, be proud, and in a calm spirit
Trusting in the future, behold your flag!
In the green you read hope of spring;
The red signifies the courage of your ancestors;
The yellow foretells the richest treasures.

Chorus

3. Beloved Benin, your sunny mountains, palm trees, and green pastures
Show everywhere your brightness;
Your soil offers everyone the richest fruits.
Benin, from henceforth your sons are united
With one brotherly spirit sharing the hope of seeing you
Enjoy abundance and happiness for ever.

		<string>The flag of Brunei, which has been adopted in 1959, is composed of a yellow leaf, black and white diagonal stripes and a national emblem in the center of the flag. However, it has not obtained status of national flag until 1984, when Brunei gained independence from Britain. National emblem consists of a red crescent at the bottom, two gloves turned to the sky at the sides and an umbrella on the top. The crescent is a traditional symbol of Islam and the umbrella stands for monarchy and royal dignity. Wings with four feathers adorning the umbrella are supposed to guard integrity and peace. Yellow is a typical color of Sultan and the diagonal stripes has been added in 1906 when Brunei became a British colony.</string>

		<string>The anthem of this tiny sultanate bordered by Malaysia was composed in 1947, almost 40 years before independence, when a group of youths decided that the nation should have a national anthem, and chose two of their own to write and compose it. Adopted in 1951, it was changed slightly upon full independence in 1984 when the Sultan’s title changed from “His Royal Highness” to “His Majesty” and thus a slight change of the lyrics was necessitated.</string>

		<string>The flag of Bolivia, whose official name is the Bolivian multinational state, has been adopted in 1851. It consists of three horizontal stripes in red, yellow and green colors. In the center of the state flag, a coat of arms is placed, however it was dropped from the national flag. The red stripe symbolizes blood shed during the struggles for freedom and also Bolivian fauna, yellow stands for mineral wealth of the country and green is to remind fertility of local land. Bolivia was originally inhabited by Aymaras and later Incas, but it was colonized by Spaniards in the 16th century and the independence has not been gained until 1825. The state was named after Simon Bolivar - the leader of the struggles for freedom.</string>

		<string>The composer of the music of this South American Spanish-speaking nation’s anthem (Leopoldo Benedetto Vincenti) is an Italian, which is not that uncommon for “Latin American epic anthems” such as this one, as they often resemble Italian operatic pieces. The author of the lyrics was an ardent patriot, a signer of the Bolivian declaration of Independence and of the first constitution of the country.</string>

1. Bolivianos: el hado propicio
coronó nuestros votos y anhelos.
Es ya libre, ya libre este suelo,
ya cesó su servil condición.
Al estruendo marcial que ayer fuera
y al clamor de la guerra horroroso,
siguen hoy, en contraste armonioso,
dulces himnos de paz y de unión.
Siguen hoy, en contraste armonioso,
dulces himnos de paz y de unión.
 
CHORUS:  
De la Patria, el alto nombre,
en glorioso esplendor conservemos.
Y en sus aras de nuevo juremos:
¡Morir antes que esclavos vivir!
¡Morir antes que esclavos vivir!
¡Morir antes que esclavos vivir!
 
2. Loor eterno a los bravos guerreros,
cuyo heroico valor y firmeza,
conquistaron las glorias que empieza
hoy Bolivia feliz a gozar.
Que sus nombres, en mármol y en bronce,
a remotas edades transmitan,
y en sonoros cantares repitan:
¡Libertad, Libertad, Libertad!
Y en sonoros cantares repitan:
¡Libertad, Libertad, Libertad!

Chorus
 
 3. Aquí alzó la justicia su trono
que la vil opresión desconoce,
y en su timbre glorioso legose
libertad, libertad, libertad.
Esta tierra inocente y hermosa
que ha debido a Bolívar su nombre
es la patria feliz donde el hombre
goza el bien de la dicha y la paz.
Es la patria feliz donde el hombre
goza el bien de la dicha y la paz.
Chorus
 
 4. Si extranjero poder alqún día
sojuzgar a Bolivia intentare,
al destino fatal se prepare
que amenaza a soberbio invasor.
Que los hijos del grande Bolívar
hayan mil y mil veces jurado:
morir antes que ver humillado
de la Patria el augusto pendón.
Morir antes que ver humillado
de la Patria el augusto pendón.

1. Bolivians, a most favorable destiny
has at long last crowned our vows and longings;
This land is free, free at last.
Its servile state has now finally ceased.
The martial turmoil of yesterday,
and the horrible clamor of war,
are followed today, in harmonious contrast,
by sweet hymns of peace and unity.
Are followed today, in harmonious contrast,
by sweet hymns of peace and unity.
 
CHORUS:  
Let us keep the lofty name of our country
in glorious splendor.
And, on its altars, once more we must swear:
to die before we would live as slaves.
To die before we would live as slaves.
To die before we would live as slaves.

2. Eternal praise to the brave warriors
whose heroic valor and firmness
conquered the freedom and glories that now
a happy Bolivia justly begins to enjoy!
Let their names, preserved forever in marble and bronze,
transmit their glory to remote future ages.
And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

Chorus
 

3. Here has Justice erected its Throne
which vile oppression ignores
and, on its glorious stamp let us rejoice
Freedom, freedom, freedom
This innocent and beautiful land,
which owes its name to Bolívar,
is the happy homeland where mankind
enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.
Is the happy homeland where mankind
enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.
Chorus
 

4. If a foreigner may, any given day
even attempt to subjugate Bolivia,
let him prepare for a fatal destiny,
which menaces such brave aggressor.
For the sons of the mighty Bolívar
have sworn, thousands upon thousands of times,
to die rather than see the country’s
majestic banner humiliated.
To die rather than see the country’s
majestic banner humiliated.
Chorus

		<string>The draft of the Brazilian flag was designed by professor Teixeira Mendes together with several astronomers and painter Decio Vilares. The flag has truly unique design - the globe in the center of the flag shows the night sky exactly as it could be observed on November 15, 1889 at 8:30 am from Rio de Janeiro (on this day the Brazilian monarchy was brought down). Every single star in the sky represents one state and the globe is surrounded by a yellow diamond, which is set in a green background. The inscription "Ordem e Progresso" on a white ribbon, which goes through the globe, means "Order and Progress". After the monarchy was brought down, a flag similar to the US flag had been adopted, however it was withdrawn after 4 days for the reason of excessive similarity.</string>

		<string>Brazil’s anthem was first performed in 1831, shortly after Brazil’s first emperor abdicated.  During the imperial period (1822-1889) and for the first few years of the republican period thereafter, the anthem was performed without words, no suitable words having been popular with the people.  After becoming a republic in 1889, it was often suggested among the republican groups in the country that a new anthem should be adopted, as the current anthem was used during the imperial era.  A new anthem was adopted that year, but was not well-recieved by the population, and the anthem of the Empire was declared official on January 20, 1890.  The anthem was still without official words, and each state started adopting their own words to the anthem.  In 1906, it was brought forward that lyrics for the anthem should be written, and in 1909 a poem by Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada was composed.  However it wasn’t until 1922, for the 100th anniversary of independence, that Osório Duque Estrada’s poem was adopted, with several changes to the text.

Brazil, like many other “federalist” nations, have states that have their own anthems as well.

1. Ouviram do Ipiranga às margens plácidas
De um povo heróico o brado retumbante,
E o sol da liberdade, em raios fúlgidos,
Brilhou no céu da Pátria nesse instante, 

Se o penhor dessa igualdade
Conseguimos conquistar com braço forte,
Em teu seio, ó, Liberdade,
Desafia o nosso peito a própria morte! 

Ó Pátria amada, Idolatrada, Salve! Salve! 

Brasil, um sonho intenso, um raio vívido,
De amor e de esperança à terra desce,
Se em teu formoso céu, risonho e límpido,
A imagem do Cruzeiro resplandece. 

Gigante pela própria natureza,
és belo, és forte, impávido colosso,
E o teu futuro espelha essa grandeza, 
 
CHORUS:  
Terra adorada, Entre outras mil, és tu, Brasil,
Ó Pátria amada! Dos filhos deste solo és mãe gentil,
Pátria amada, Brasil!

2. Deitado eternamente em berço esplêndido,
ao som do mar e à luz do céu profundo,
Fulguras, ó Brasil, florão da América,
Iluminado ao sol do novo mundo! 

Do que a terra mais garrida
Teus risonhos lindos campos tem mais flores,
“Nossos bosques tem mais vida”
“Nossa vida” no teu seio “mais amores” 

Ó Pátria amada, Idolatrada, Salve! Salve! 

Brasil, de amor eterno seja símbolo
O lábaro que ostentas estrelado,
E diga o verde-louro dessa flâmula
“Paz no futuro e glória no passado.” 

Mas se ergues da justiça a clava forte,
Verás que um filho teu não foge à luta,
Nem teme, quem te adora, a própria morte,

1. The Ypiranga’s placid banks heard 
The resounding shouting of a heroic people.
And the sun of freedom, in bright rays,
Shone at this moment in the homeland’s skies.
As the promise of this equality
Was secured by our strong arms,
In your bosom, O Freedom,
We are ready to die.

O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!
Brazil, a vivid dream, a lively ray
Of love and hope settles on the earth,
As in your beautiful sky, smiling and limpid,
The image of the Southern Cross shines resplendent.
A giant by nature, you are beautiful,
Strong, an intrepid colossus,
And your future mirrors this grandeur.
 
CHORUS:  
O land we adore, among a thousand others
You are the beloved one.
You are the gentle mother of the sons of this land,
Beloved homeland, Brazil!

2. Eternally laid in a splendid cradle,
To the sound of the sea and the light from the depths of the sky,
Brazil, you gleam, fleuron of the Americas,
Illuminated by the sun of the New World.
Your smiling, lovely fields have more flowers
Than the most attractive land elsewhere,
Our forests have more life,
Our life in your bosom more love.

O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!
Brazil, may you have as eternal symbol
The starry banner you display,
And may the green laurel of this pennant speak
Of peace in the future and glory in the past.
But if you raise a strong cudgel in the name of justice,
You will see that a son of yours does not run from a fight,
Nor does one who adores you fear death.

		<string>Bahamian islands are located in the southeast direction from Florida and it have slightly over 300,000 inhabitants. These islands used to be a British colony until gaining the independence in 1973, when the current flag of the Bahamas was adopted as well. Afterwards, the economy has begun to focus on tourism and trade and this trend remained till nowadays. At the same time, a drug trafficking is a big issue and a large part of the workforce migrates to the USA every year. The black wedge on the left side of the flag is supposed to represent the black population of the island, blue stripes stand for the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

		<string>The flag of Bhutan reflects the country´s name in the local language (Druk Yul), which means "country of the thunder dragon". This name is linked to the Buddhist monastery Druk, which was reportedly founded in the country in the 13th century. The diagonal divides the flag into yellow and orange part. Yellow color refers to the secular side of life, whereas orange indicates the strength of the Buddhist religion in the country. White dragon stands for purity and the jewelry in his talons refer to the great wealth of the country. The dragon stares away from the left part of the flag and his body copies the diagonal line. The current form of the flag was adopted in 1960, however is has been used since the 19th century in a slightly modified form.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>“Druk tsendhen” (The Thunder Dragon Kingdom) is how Bhutanese also refer to their country. The music is reminiscent of the native style of music in that region. The composer of the anthem was trained in India, becoming that country’s first bandmaster. After his return to Bhutan, the Indian prime minsiter paid a visit to the country, and the anthem was composed for the occassion, on the request of the Bhutanese king. The original tune was based on the folk song “Thri nyampa med pa pemai thri” (“The Unchanging Lotus Throne”). An interesting note is that the folk song has choreography that goes along with it, making this possibly the only national anthem to be based on a choreographical work.</string>

		<string>The flag of Botswana, which has been adopted in 1966 during the declaration of independence, is composed of a pale blue sheet, which bears a black horizontal stripe in its center. Moreover, the entire sheet and the stripe are bounded by a white trim. The symbolism of colors has several interpretations. One of them says that the flag has been inspired by a state symbol, whose motto is Pula (Setswana in the local language), which means "Let there be rain". Therefore, blue color should symbolize water, black and white stripes are supposed to commemorate zebra, the national animal of Botswana and also shield bearer. Three colors can also represent various ethnic groups living in the country and hope for their peaceful coexistence.</string>

		<string>The Belarusian flag consists of two horizontal stripes - wider red one at the top and narrower green one at the bottom. Moreover, the left edge of the flag is fringed by traditional Belarusian red and white pattern. This ornament is used to decorate folk costumes, and it should indicate the age of Belarusian nation and its manual dexterity and skills. The flag was adopted in 1995 after a referendum and it replaced the flag that Belarus used before annexing to the Soviet Union and after gaining the independence in 1991. However, some interest groups are still using the original flag to express the disagreement with the government and they deem the referendum of 1995 invalid since it allegedly failed to meet democratic principles.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus kept the anthem it used as a soviet socialist republic since 1955, without the words. (Many SSR’s have used an wordless, or instrumental, version of the SSR hymn very soon after achieving independence.) Replacing the work outright with a new song was considered, and suggestions such as “Магутны Божа!” (“Mahutny Bozha”) [O God Almighty] by Natalla Arsiennieva (which was recommended by the parliamentary education and culture committee in 1995, but was not acted upon) and “Маладая Беларусь” “Maładaja Biełaruś” [Young Belarus] by Janka Kupala (but was never set to music) were put forward, but no change was made.

On July 2, 2002, President Lukashenko set a decree that the Belarus hymn will have lyrics, and ones were adopted in a contest. The lyrics by the contest winner, Uladzimir Karyzna,  were similar to the Belarusian SSR anthem lyrics and were based on Klimkovich’s original lyrics for the soviet republic’s anthem. 

Protestors against Lukashenko’s government use a variety of songs, including the aforementioned hymn “Mahutny Bozha” and the anthem of the last Belarusian state, “Vajacki mars”.

You soar up proudly, into the bright heights,
The banner of victory, the banner of joy!

		<string>The flag of Belize has been adopted in 1981, when the country achieved independence from the Great Britain. The flag was designed around 1950, when the country began to fight for independence and is it based on the design of the former flag from this period. At that time, Belize was called British Honduras. The current version of the flag is composed of a blue sheet and a national emblem in the middle. The red stripes are not original and were added after gaining the independence. The national coat of arms shows two workers standing in the shade of mahogany, the first one holding an oar and the second one an ax. Below the workers, there is a ribbon with inscription "Sub umbra floreo" (in the shadow flourish) - which clearly refers to the colonial past of Belize.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem was first written in 1963 by a Belize citizen who fought on the side of the British in World War I.  After his return from the war, he was actively involved in local movements that encouraged Belizian identity and towards the removal of racial discrimination in Belize; the anthem may have been written with these sentiments in mind.  The original title was “Land of the Gods” in response to the prevalence of religious observance in the country.  It was adopted upon independence from Great Britain in 1981.  (The British anthem is still retained in Belize as the royal anthem, as the British royal family is retained as Belize’s head of state.)

Presently there has been some debate about the anthem and if it should be replaced.  The ruling party of the day unilaterally adopted the anthem upon independence and the choice of an anthem was not put to the population to decide, although the choice was agreed upon by the people.  Also, there has been issue by womens’ groups in the country with phrases such as “Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty” and to the militaristic imagery in the chorus.

1. O, land of the free by the Carib Sea,
our manhood we pledge to thy liberty!
No tyrants here linger, despots must flee
This tranquil haven of democracy
The blood of our sires which hallows the sod,
Brought freedom from slavery oppression’s rod,
By the might of truth and the grace of God.
No longer shall we be hewers of wood.

CHORUS:
Arise! ye sons of the Baymen’s clan,
put on your armour, clear the land!
Drive back the tyrants, let despots flee-
Land of the Free by the Carib Sea!

2. Nature has blessed thee with wealth untold,
O’er mountains and valleys where praries roll;
Our fathers, the Baymen, valiant and bold
Drove back the invader; this heritage hold
From proud Rio Hondo to old Sarstoon’
Through coral isle, over blue lagoon;
Keep watch with the angels, the stars and moon;
For freedom comes tomorrow’s noon.

		<string>The current Canadian flag was raised up in 1965 for the first time. Its author was Dr. George Stanley, who intended to capture several important elements of Canadian history. The central theme of the flag is a maple leaf, which refers to the indigenous population that has been using the maple sap for centuries, and which still is a traditional Canadian product. Maple leaf became a symbol of Canadian athletes in the 20th century and also a symbol of Canadian soldiers in both world wars. Red leaf is placed on a white background and the flag is lined with two vertical red stripes. Red and white are referring to historical ties to the UK – it was red and white flag with the St. George's cross which was erected by John Cabot on Canadian soil in 1497.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The original French lyrics of “O Canada” were written in 1880 as a patriotic poem by Adolphe-Basile Routhier, a judge; it was set to music by a prominent French-Canadian composer of the time, Calixa Lavallée and was sung for the first time on June 24 of that year at a banquet in the Pavillion des Patineurs in Quebec City. 

When Routhier’s lyrics were first published in Toronto, a doctor named Thomas Bedford Richardson translated the words of the first and fourth verses into English and to fit the melody. Two years later, the first edition of the Canadian version of Collier’s Weekly held a competition to write English lyrics to the song. Mercy E. Powell McCulloch won the competition with her entry. The words were rewritten again and again, but one version gained the most popularity. It was written by Montreal lawyer Robert Stanley Weir, and only slightly differs from the English version used today.  (Note that while Richardson’s lyrics are meant to be a somewhat direct translation of the French lyrics into English, Powell McCulloch’s and Weir’s lyrics (the latter of which are nearly identical to the current lyrics) are completely different in meaning from the original French lyrics.  The lyrics to the right give the official lyrics in both English and French, as well as the official translation of the French lyrics.)

The anthem’s English lyrics were performed for Edward VIII in 1936 and King George VI in 1939 on their visits to Canada, and the Kings saluted the song as if it was the national anthem.  It then started to be used more frequently as an unofficial anthem and in 1967 it was approved by Parliament as the national anthem, and was made official by the National Anthem Act of 1980.  The national anthem officially only consists of one verse in each language, yet the original poems of both Routhier and Weir have four verses.

Since the adoption of the anthem, there has been occassional attempts to once more slightly alter the English lyrics of the national anthem, to change the gender-specificness of the phrase “in all thy sons command”, or to alter the phrase “our home and native land” to reflect the new immigrants of the country, or to remove the reference to God.  To date, however, the lyrics remain unchanged.

Before the official adoption of “O Canada” in 1980, the official national anthem of Canada was “God Save the Queen”, yet “O Canada” was used on an unofficial basis, as well as the patriotic song “The Maple Leaf Forever”.  “God Save the Queen” remains the royal anthem of Canada.

There are also other patriotic songs (including “The Maple Leaf Forever,” mentioned above) for Canada and her provinces and regions as well as the nation as a whole, you can find a list at the website of Canadian Heritage (a government agency).

		<string>Congo first adopted its anthem upon independence in 1960. Known as Congo (Kinshasa) at the time of independence, to differentiate it from its neighbour to the west of the same name, the anthem was kept until 1971, when the national symbols were changed and the country’s name was changed to Zaire. A coup in 1997 restored the national symbols, including the name and anthem, back to the symbols adopted upon independence. The author and composer also wrote Zaire‘s anthem.

		<string>The flag of the Central African Republic has been adopted in 1958 and it was designed by president of the Oubangui-Chari province Barthelemy Boganda, a big advocate of partnership with France. The flag consists in total of five stripes, four of which are horizontal and one is vertical. Red, white and blue stripes refer to the colonial past of the country and pan-African colors red, yellow and green refer to solidarity with the other African nations. The red vertical bar that connects the other stripes should commemorate bloodshed during various struggles for freedom. Moreover, at the top of the left part of the flag, a yellow five-pointed star - a symbol of African unity, progress and tolerance, is placed.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The melody of the anthem was composed by the same person who wrote the melody for the Senegalese anthem, a French ethnomusicologist who went to the Central African Republic to study the local music and was asked by Barthélémy Boganda, later the first prime minister of the country who was killed shortly before independence, to put to music the lyrics of the national anthem that he wrote.

It is unclear as to who the composer and lyricist are for this anthem, some sources give the authors as Jacques Tondra and Georges (Levent) Kibanghi, with Jean Royer and Joseph Spadilière as the composers, and some list Kibanghi as the sole lyricist and Tondra as the sole composer.

		<string>The roots of the Swiss square flag with the traditional white isosceles cross on a red background date back to the Middle Ages. At that time, Switzerland was a part of the Holy Roman Empire and thus the cross symbolizes Christianity and red color refers to the blood of Christian martyrs. In the 13th century, several Swiss administrative units had joined together and then succeeded in gaining independence from the Holy Roman Empire. Therefore, the flag may evoke independence and democracy. As Switzerland is known for its long term political neutrality, the flag may also symbolize peace and a safe asylum. An interesting fact is that the exact dimensions of the cross or shade of red are not predetermined, so the versions of the flag may slightly differ.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In the summer of 1841, Alberik Zwyssig received a piece of mail from Leonhard Widmer, a music publisher, journalist and lyricist from Zurich. The mail contained a patriotic poem that Widmer had written and wanted set to music. Zwyssig chose to use a hymn that he had composed to the psalm “Diligam te Domine” (I will love Thee, O Lord) for an ordination service in 1835 when he was music director at the monastery in Wettingen. On November 22, 1841, Zwyssig rehearsed his “Schweizerpsalm” for the first time with four residents of Zug. The song turned out to be very popular in several Swiss cantons, and numerous attempts were made between 1894 and 1953 to have it declared the Swiss national anthem, but they were consistently turned down by the Swiss government for the reason that a national anthem should not be selected by government decree but by popular opinion. 

It was due to the fact that the anthem in use at the time had the same melody as the British anthem, that the Swiss government declared the “Swiss Psalm”, a fully and unmistakably Swiss creation, the provisional Swiss national anthem in 1961, the provisional clause was abandoned in 1975, but without official ratification as the national anthem. A number of other suggestions for a national anthem were made in the years that followed, none of which, however, earned nearly as many votes as the “Swiss Psalm”. Finally, on April 1, 1981, the “Swiss Psalm” was officially declared the Swiss national anthem, “a purely Swiss song, dignified and ceremonial, the kind of national anthem that the majority of our citizens would like to have.”

Switzerland has four official languages, the French, Italian and Romansch versions are official translations of Widmer’s original German lyrics. Some of Switzerland’s cantons (especially those with a recent history of independence outside of Switzerland) have their own anthems, Neuchatel’s cantonal anthem, for example, uses the same melody as the former Swiss anthem, that is “God save the King (Queen)”.

1. Sur nos monts, quand le soleil
Annonce un brillant réveil,
Et prédit d’un plus beau jour Le retour,
Les beautés de la patrie
Parlent à l’âme attendrie;
Au ciel montent plus joyeux
Les accents d’un coeur pieux,

Notre coeur pressent encore le Dieu fort.

Offrons-Lui de coeurs pieux 
Offrons-Lui de coeurs pieux 
Dieu nous bénira des cieux, 
Dieu nous bénira du hauts des cieux. 

4. Des grand monts vient le secours, 
Suisse! espère en Dieu toujours! 
Garde la foi des aïeux, vis comme eux! 
Sur l’autel de la partrie 
Met tes biens, ton coeurs, ta vie! 
C’est le trésor précieux 
C’est le trésor précieu 
Que Dieu nous bénira des cieux, 
Que Dieu nous bénira du hauts des cieux.

1. Quando bionda aurora
il mattin c’indora
l’alma mia t’adora
re del ciel!
Quando l’alpe già rosseggia
a pregare allor t’atteggia;
in favor del patrio suol,
in favor del patrio suol,
cittadino Iddio lo vuol,
cittadino Dio, si Dio lo vuol.
 
2. Se di stelle è un giubilo
la celeste sfera
Te ritrovo a sera
o Signor!
Nella notte silenziosa
l’alma mia in Te riposa:
libertà, concordia, amor,
libertà, concordia, amor,
all’Elvezia serba ognor,
all’Elvezia serba ognor.
 
3. Se di nubi un velo
m’asconde il tuo cielo  
pel tuo raggio anelo
Dio d’amore!
Fuga o sole quei vapori
e mi rendi i tuoi favori:
di mia patria deh! Pietà
di mia patria deh! Pietà
brilla, o sol di verità,
brilla sol, o sol di verità!
 
4. Quando rugge e strepita
impetuoso il nembo
m’è ostel tuo grembo
o Signor!
In te fido Onnipossente
deh, proteggi nostra gente;
Libertà, concordia, amor,
Libertà, concordia, amor,
all’Elvezia serba ognor
all’Elvezia serba ognor.

1. When the morning skies grow red 
And o’er their radiance shed, 
Thou, O Lord, appeareth in their light. 
When the Alps glow bright with splendour, 
Pray to God, to Him surrender, 
For you feel and understand, 
For you feel and understand, 
That he dwelleth in this land. 
That he dwelleth in this land. 

2. In the sunset Thou art nigh 
And beyond the starry sky, 
Thou, O loving Father, ever near 
When to Heaven we are departing, 
Joy and bliss Thou’lt be imparting, 
For we feel and understand 
For we feel and understand 
That Thou dwellest in this land. 
That Thou dwellest in this land. 

3. When dark clouds enshroud the hills 
And gray mist the valley fills, 
Yet Thou art not hidden from Thy sons. 
Pierce the gloom in which we cower 
With Thy sunshine’s cleansing power 
Then we’ll feel and understand 
Then we’ll feel and understand 
That God dwelleth in this land. 
That God dwelleth in this land. 

4. Towards us in the wild storm coming,
You yourself give us resistance and stronghold,
You, almighty ruling, rescuing!
During horror and nights of thunderstorms
Let us childlike trust Him!
Yes, we feel and understand;
Yes, we feel and understand
That God dwelleth in this land.
That God dwelleth in this land.

		<key>flagInfo</key>
		<string>Chilean flag bears the colors of flag of the United States and it has origins in the period of struggles for liberation in 1817. The flag is composed of red and white horizontal stripes, and a blue square with a white five-pointed star in the upper left part of the flag. White should symbolize, like the name of the country itself (Tchili means snow in the local language), the snowy peaks of the Andes. The blue represents the sky beneath which blood was shed during the local struggles for independence. These fights are reminded by the red stripe. The origin of the star is associated with the Chilean Indians - its white color allegedly represents the unity and freedom of the nation, and the five points represent the five original provinces of the country.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>After the melody of Chile’s original anthem was replaced in 1828, the original text, from 1819, was also in need of replacement to remove the anti-Spanish sentiments from the lyrics.  In 1847, the young poet Eusebio Lillo wrote a new text to Carnicer’s melody, however he kept the chorus from the original anthem. Today, the chorus and fifth verse of Lillo’s poem make up the official national anthem of Chile.

Following the coup d’etat by Augusto Pinochet in 1973, the military junta dictated that two verses would be used along with the chorus: the fifth verse was retained, and the third verse, which extolled Chile’s army, was then added as the second official verse. It was a common act of protest by detractors to remain silent during the second verse. When democracy was restored in 1990, the government removed the military verse and restored the anthem as it was before the coup; today, supporters of the past military government still sing the third verse.

Either you’ll be the tomb of the free
Or the refuge against oppression

		<string>The flag of Cameroon consists of three vertical stripes in traditional pan-African colors - green, red, and yellow. In the middle of the central red stripe, a yellow five-pointed star is placed. As in case of other African states, the design of the flag was inspired by the French flag. Originally, Cameroon was divided into the British and the French part, but in 1961 a federation was created and two stars representing each of the original colonial powers were added on the flag. After some time, one of the stars was omitted as an expression of unity and integrity of Cameroon. Today, the star is interpreted as a unity, green color evokes forests, red stands for independence, and yellow refers to Cameroon´s savannahs and sun.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem of this central African French-English bilingual country was written in 1928, and was used as an unofficial anthem in 1948. Official use came in 1957, when Cameroon became an autonomous republic within France. Finally, the lyrics were changed slightly in 1978, to the current version.

Like Canada (another French-English bilingual country), the English and French lyrics are slightly different, on the right is provided the lyrics in each official language, with an English translation of the French lyrics.

Va, debout et jaloux de ta liberté.
Comme un soleil ton drapeau fier doit être,

One day we finally arrived.
Africa’s children be faithful
And still progressing in peace
Hoping that your children

Holy Shrine where in our midst they now repose, 
Their tears and blood and sweat thy soil did water, 
On thy hills and valleys once their tillage rose.

How can we ever pay thy due? 
Thy welfare we will win in toil and love and peace, 
Will be to thy name ever true!

From along the banks of lowly Boumba Stream, 
Muster thy sons in union close around thee, 
Mighty as the Buea Mountain be their team; 
Instil in them the love of gentle ways, 
Regret for errors of the past; 
Foster, for Mother Africa, a loyalty 
That true shall remain to the last.

		<string>China’s anthem, written in 1935, was adopted when the Communists took power in 1949. The anthem was also the theme song of the film, “Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm”. The film tells the story of those who went to the front to fight the Japanese invaders in northeast China in the 1930s, when the fate of the nation was hanging in the balance. The “March of the Volunteers” gave voice to the Chinese people’s determination to sacrifice themselves for national liberation, expressing China’s admirable tradition of courage, resolution and unity in fighting foreign aggression. The anthem is almost never known as “义勇军进行曲” (“Yìyǒngjūn Jìnxíngqǔ”) [the March of the Volunteers]. Most people in China just call it the “中国国歌” (“Zhōngguó guógē”) [Chinese National Song], or, more formally, the “中华人民共和国国歌”(“Zhōnghuá rénmín gònghéguó guógē”) [National Song of the People’s Republic of China]. 

During the Cultural Revolution (a period of Chinese history roughly from the mid 1960s to the early or mid 1970s, when Mao Zedong was in power), “The March of the Volunteers” was forbidden to be sung (Tian Han, the writer of the lyrics, was also imprisoned), and the song “The East Is Red” (a song that mentions the Communist party and Mao, neither of which are in “The March of the Volunteers”) was the de facto anthem. In 1978, after Mao’s death, “The March of the Volunteers” was restored as the anthem, but with different words, which mention Mao and the Party. The original lyrics were restored in 1982.

		<string>The Colombian flag consists of three horizontal stripes - yellow, red, and blue one, where the yellow one is wider compared to the other stripes. The flag should express the unity of the Colombian population which has experienced many difficulties over time. Yellow color symbolizes Colombian gold, blue the Pacific Ocean bathing the Colombian shores, and the red refers to the blood shed during the struggle for freedom. Other interpretations says that yellow indicates sovereignty, blue nobility, and red bravery. After its discovery, Colombia became a Spanish colony and did not gain independence until the 19th century. The modern history could be characterized by political instability and fight against drugs in the countryside.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In 1887, a Bogota comedian named José Domingo Torres, combined his two passions of theatrical music and his love for his country to push for the creation of a national anthem for Colombia. He decided to use as the lyrics of the anthem an inspiration poem written by then President Rafael Núñez commemorating the city of Cartagena, and asked his friend Oreste Sindici, an Italian opera teacher, to compose the music. (One common characteristic of Latin American epic anthems such as Colombia’s is that the music often resembles Italian operas.) The anthem was first performed in November of that year in a music hall in the public school where Sindici taught. The anthem was officially adopted by Congress in 1920, and an official transcription was made in 1946. The anthem is always performed starting with the chorus, then a verse, then the chorus, any one of the eleven verses can be used.</string>

La libertad sublime  
Derrama las auroras  
De su invencible luz.  
La humanidad entera,  
Que entre cadenas gime,  
Comprende las palabras  
Del que murió en la cruz 

Chorus

2. “Independencia” grita
El mundo americano:
Se baña en sangre de héroes
La tierra de Colón.
Pero este gran principio: 
“El rey no es soberano”
Resuena, Y los que sufren
Bendicen su pasión. 

Chorus

3. Del Orinoco el cauce
Se colma de despojos,
De sangre y llanto un río 
Se mira allí correr.
En Bárbula no saben
Las almas ni los ojos
Si admiración o espanto
Sentir o padecer. 

Chorus

4. A orillas del Caribe
Hambriento un pueblo lucha 
Horrores prefiriendo
A pérfida salud.
iexcl;Oh, sí! de Cartagena
La abnegación es mucha,
Y escombros de la muerte
desprecian su virtud.  

Chorus

5. De Boyacá en los campos
El genio de la gloria
Con cada espiga un héroe
invicto coronó.
Soldados sin coraza
Ganaron la victoria;
Su varonil aliento
De escudo les sirvió. 

Chorus

6. Bolívar cruza el Ande
Que riega dos océanos
Espadas cual centellas
Fulguran en Junín.
Centauros indomables
Descienden a los llanos
Y empieza a presentirse
De la epopeya el fin. 

Chorus

7. La trompa victoriosa
Que en Ayacucho truena
En cada triunfo crece
Su formidable son.
En su expansivo empuje
La libertad se estrena,
Del cielo Americano
Formando un pabellón. 

Chorus

8. La Virgen sus cabellos
Arranca en agonía
Y de su amor viuda
Los cuelga del ciprés.
Lamenta su esperanza
Que cubre losa fría;
Pero glorioso orgullo
circunda su alba tez. 

Chorus

9. La Patria así se forma
Termópilas brotando;
Constelación de cíclopes 
Su noche iluminó;
La flor estremecida
Mortal el viento hallando
Debajo los laureles
Seguridad buscó 

Chorus

10. Mas no es completa gloria 
Vencer en la batalla,
Que al brazo que combate 
Lo anima la verdad.
La independencia sola
El gran clamor no acalla:
Si el sol alumbra a todos
Justicia es libertad. 

Chorus

11. Del hombre los derechos
Nariño predicando,
El alma de la lucha
Profético enseñó.
Ricaurte en San Mateo
En átomos volando
“Deber antes que vida”,
Con llamas escribió.

1. The horrible night has ceased,
the sublime liberty
spills the auroras
of its invincible light.
All humanity,
moans within its chains,
understands the words

2. “Independence!” cries
the American world;
soaked in blood of heroes
the land of Columbus.
Still, one great principle,
“The king is not sovereign”,
resounds, and those who suffer
bless their passion.

Chorus

3. The Orinoco’s bed
fills with the remains,
of blood and tears a river
is there seen flowing.
In Bárbula they don’t know
the souls nor the eyes,
if admiration or horror
feel or suffer.

Chorus

4. On the shores of the Caribbean,
famished, the people fight,
horrors preferring
to treacherous health.
O, aye! for Cartagena
the abnegation is much,
and the shambles of death
its courage despises.

Chorus

5. From Boyacá in the fields,
the genius of glory,
for every ear a hero
undefeated crowned.
Soldiers without breastplate
won victory;
their virile breath
as shield served.

Chorus

6. Bolivar crosses the Andes
that two oceans bathe,
swords as sparks
shine in Junín.
Untameable centaurs
descend to the plains,
and a prescience begins to be felt,
of the epic the end.

Chorus

7. The victorious trumpet
in Ayacucho thunders,
that in every triumph grows
its formidable sound.
In its expansive thrust
Liberty is worn for the first time,
from the American sky
a pavilion forming.

Chorus

8. The virgin her hairs
pulls out in agony
and from her beloved widowed
hangs them on a cypress.
Regretting her hope
covered by a cold headstone,
but glorious pride
hallows her fair skin.

Chorus

9. Thus the motherland is formed,
Thermopylaes are breaking forth;
constellation of cyclops
its night brightened.
The trembling flower
finding the wind mortal,
underneath the laurels
safety sought.

Chorus

10. But it’s not complete glory
to defeat in battle,
that the arm that fights
is encouraged by truth.
Independence alone
The great clamour doesn’t silence;
if the sun illuminates everyone,
justice is liberty.

Chorus

11. From men the rights
Nariño’s preaching,
the soul of struggle
prophetically taught.
Ricaurte in San Mateo,
in atoms flying,
“Duty before life,”
with flames he wrote.

Chorus

		<string>The flag of Costa Rica is composed of five horizontal stripes of blue, white, red, white, and blue colors in the ratio 1: 1: 2: 1: 1. On the left side of the red stripe, a national coat of arms from 1848 is placed, though it was redesigned in 1906. The emblem consists of an image of three Costa Rican volcanoes surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean on whose surface a sailboat sails. Moreover, the sun rises above the volcanoes and it dominates the sky along with seven five-pointed stars, which represent the seven provinces of Costa Rica. The coat of arms also contains two inscriptions - REPUBLICA DE COSTA RICA and CENTRAL AMERICA. The red stripe was added on the flag in 1848 - since that time the flag resembles the French tricolor and thus indirectly celebrates the French Revolution.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In 1852, Costa Rica did not have a national anthem. However, when the United States and the United Kingdom accredited their diplomatic representatives in Costa Rica, the president wanted to host a welcome ceremony for the missions. A decision was made that a national anthem for Costa Rica should be composed for the occassion, and the president requested Mr. Manuel María Gutiérrez, Director of the Costa Rican National Army Orchestra, to compose the music and it was first performed for the occassion on June 11 of that year.

Several sets of lyrics were used since the melody was created, and in 1900, a contest was held to replace the existing lyrics to the anthem, which was won by José María Zeledón Brenes. Despite having the words and anthem officially composed and in common use, they were not declared as the official national anthem until 1949.</string>

Noble patria tu hermosa bandera
Expresión de tu vida nos da:
Bajo el límpido azul de tu cielo
Blanca y pura descansa la paz.
 
En la lucha tenaz de fecunda labor
Que enrojece del hombre la faz,
Conquistaron tus hijos, labriegos sencillos,
Eterno prestigio, estima y honor,

		<string>The Cuban flag consists of five horizontal stripes where two are white and three are blue. In the left part of the flag, a red triangle and a white five-pointed star are located. The flag was adopted in 1902, but it was designed already in 1849 by Narciso Lopez. Lopez was fighting for independence from Spain and he wanted Cuba to join the United States. And that is why he placed there one white star (in Spanish "Estrella Solitaria"), which, according to his plan, should later become one of the stars on the American flag. This vision, however, never materialized and Cuba became a communist country. Three blue stripes denote three Cuban departments, white purity of ideals of people fighting for independence, and red recalls the blood shed during these fights. Each of the peaks of the triangle points to one of the ideals of the Cuban revolution - liberty, equality, and fraternity.</string>

		<string>“La Bayamesa” (The Bayamo Song) was first performed in 1868 during the battle of Bayamo in a Cuban uprising against Spain.  The author of the song played a leading part in the battle, and was captured by the Spaniards and executed by a firing squad in 1870; it is said that just before the firing squad executed Figueredo, he shouted one of the lines from the anthem:  “Morir por la Patria es vivir”.

Officially adopted in 1940 albear start(using only the first verse of the much longer, anti-Spanish work)albear end, the anthem was retained even after the communist revolution in 1959.  The anthem is usually performed with a musical introduction, which was composed by Antonio Rodriguez-Ferrer.

		<string>The flag of Cape Verde, which has been adopted in 1992, is composed of a blue sheet and three stripes in white and red colors. The flag also bears ten five-pointed stars arranged in a circle where the circle is centered toward the left side of the flag. The blue color represents the sea and the sky and two white and one red stripe should commemorate the country's development and the path towards progress. Ten stars represent ten islands of Cape Verde archipelago and the circle is to symbolize the unity of the nation. The islands lying near the west coast of Africa were settled by the Portuguese in the 19th century and in these times it was an important trade crossroad.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>From independence in 1975 to 1996, Cabo Verde (known until late 2013 as Cape Verde) shared the same anthem as Guinea-Bissau, to reflect a proposed merger of these two Portuguese speaking nations. However, when that failed to materialize, Cabo Verde change her flag and anthem to have national symbols more unique to their own nation.

		<string>The flag of Cyprus consists of a yellow silhouette of the island and two crossed branches on a white background. Yellow color evokes copper resources on the island, which are reflected even in the name “Cyprus” itself since it is derived from a Greek word for copper. Crossed branches should represent the desire for peaceful coexistence between Greek Cypriots and Turks inhabiting the island. Blue and red as the colors of the Greek and the Cypriot flags were not used on purpose. The current flag came into force in 1960 after gaining the independence over the Great Britain and it was designed by elementary school teacher and approved by the first president of Cyprus. The flag could have been replaced in 2004, but the proposal did not pass through referendum. Turkish Cypriots use their own flag, nevertheless it is not internationally recognized.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Cyprus is a bi-national community of Greeks and Turks, where Greeks are the majority and the ruling government. When Cyprus was declared independent from Great Britian in 1960, other national symbols such as the flag were enshrined in the new nation’s constitution, but there was no mention of an anthem. Much debates ensued, and neither community could agree on a national anthem; during foreign state visits, different instrumental marches were used. cahoon, per http://www.presidency.gov.cy/presidency/presidency.nsf/prc34_en/prc34_en?opendocumentOn November 16, 1966cahoon end, it was unilaterally decided by the Greek members of government (the Turkish members had already boycotted the government by this point) that the Greek anthem would be used by Cyprus as well. (The Turkish community does not recognize this and instead uses the Turkish anthem for their self-proclaimed nation.)

In 2004, as a requirement of joining the European Union, a peace plan was proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, which included different national symbols, to make them more inclusive of both communities. This also included a wordless anthem that was agreed to by both Turkish and Greek members of the national symbols committee. However, the plan was rejected by the voters and the Greek “Ode to Freedom” remains the Cypriot national anthem.

		<string>The flag of the Czech Republic consists of two equally broad stripes, where the lower one is red and the upper one is white. Between the stripes in the left part of the flag, there is a blue wedge. The flag symbolizes national unity, which has been very important for the country whose identity has been tested so many times during the last century. In 1918, an independent Czechoslovak state was formed and in these times, we can find the origin of the current flag. After the WWII in 1948, the country´s government was overtaken by communists and in 1993 Czechoslovakia split into the independent Czech Republic and Slovakia. After the separation, the Czech Republic kept the flag and the interpretation of the flag has been changed slightly. Blue wedge, which originally represented Slovakia, stands for Moravia today.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The music to the anthem was composed by F. Škroup, a main Revivalist composer of Czech music and especially Czech opera. The lyrics were taken from the first stanza of the opera “Fidlovačka”, which was written by Tyl and performed in 1834.  The song originally had two verses but when it became the first part of the Czechoslovak state anthem after the country’s liberation in 1918, only one verse was used. Upon dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 1 January 1993, the song became the anthem of the new Czech Republic (sometimes known as Czechia), but only the first verse remains the official anthem.

		<string>The black-red-yellow tricolor of the current German flag experienced remarkable development hand in hand with historical events. In the mid-19th century, these colors symbolized efforts to unify the German states. In 1919, the tricolor became the official flag of the Weimar Republic. However, when Hitler took the power in 1933, it was abolished and replaced by Nazi swastika. Shortly after the defeat in the World War II, the tricolor was re-adopted as the flag of modern Germany. The flag of East Germany differed a little bit by a symbol of communism in its middle. However, it was withdrawn after the unification of these two countries and the role of the national flag of the united Germany was overtaken by the flag of the German Federal Republic.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The text of the anthem has been written in 1841 by the liberal poet and professor August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, using the melody of the Austrian imperial anthem “Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser” (God save Franz our Emperor), which has been composed by the famous classical composer Joseph Haydn in 1797 and which appears in his “Emperor Quartet”. Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote his text on the small island of Helgoland off the Northwest German coast, which at that time was under British rule. He had been deported from the Kingdom of Hannover because of his liberal ideas, which included the demand to establish Germany as a unified nation. Consequently, the first verse of the “Lied der Deutschen”, beginning with the words “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles” (Germany, Germany above all) was originally meant as an appeal that the idea of a unified Germany should be more important than the many particular principalities which existed at that time.

However, when Germany became a united country in 1871, the “Lied der Deutschen” was ignored officially despite it still being a popular anthem; rather the the former Prussian royal anthem “Heil Dir im Siegerkranz” was used unofficially. Although Germany had been proclaimed a Republic on 9th November 1918 upon its defeat in World War I, it needed nearly four years until the “Deutschlandlied” was declared the new national anthem by the social democratic President Friedrich Ebert on August 11th, 1922, popp startalthough it was used on state occasions in the intervening years.popp end At that time, all three verses were used and was commonly (but unofficially) known by the opening line of the first verse, “Deutschland Über Alles” (Germany Above All).

 The anthem was even retained when the Nazis seized power in 1933, however the first verse of Hoffmann von Fallersleben’s lyrics was misused as a slogan that Germany should rule “above all” other countries, and the anthem was added with the party song of the Nazi party, the Horst Wessel Lied and known collectively as “Lieder der Nation” (Song of the Nation). In 1945, the use of all national symbols of Nazi Germany, including the “Deutschlandlied” was prohibited by the Allies. 

In 1945, Germany was governed by the Allied powers and thus had no official anthem. And when West and East Germany were founded in 1949, initially neither state wished to use the “Deutschlandlied” because of its association with the Nazi government and its misuse of the sentiment in the lyrics.

 After Germany had become reunified on 3rd October 1990, Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker confirmed in a letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, dated 19th August 1991, that the third verse of Hoffmann von Fallersleben’s “Lied der Deutschen” with Joseph Haydn’s melody are the official national anthem of the reunified Germany. (Between the time of reunification in 1990 and the official adoption of the third verse of the “Deutschlandlied”, the West German anthem was in use, which is essentially identical to the current anthem.)  Contrary to popular belief, no stanza is currently forbidden to be sung, however only the third stanza is the official national anthem, sung on official state occasions; other stanzas may be performed for other uses.  (Performance of the first verse, though, is often seen as an extremist, right-wing act.)

The regions of Germany also have their own local anthems, some have been used for centuries, some are new inventions after the war.

Moreover, a red five-pointed star is located in the white wedge. The flag has been inspired by the flag of the National League for Independence, which established itself in the struggles for independence from France. Djibouti was known as Somaliland in colonial times. The blue color of the upper bar is typical of the Somali Issas and the green color of the lower bar represents the Muslim Afars.

		<string>The Danish flag, also called Danneborg ("Danish cloth" in Danish), consists of a red background and white cross which extends to the edges of the flag. The vertical arm of the cross follows the model of the other Scandinavian flag thus it is located closer to the left side of the flag. According to the legend, the flag was sent down from heaven in order to help the Danish army on June 15, 1219 during the Battle of Lyndanise. King Valdemar II. would nearly lose the battle against the pagan Estonians, if there was not a sign from heaven that gave the army new energy that helped them to win the battle. The flag is also used in a little bit modified version as a naval flag - it is square and it has two little flags similar to swallowtail.</string>

		<string>“Der er et yndigt land” was first performed for a large gathering of Danes in 1844, and became popular quickly with the Danish people. It was adopted later that year by the Danish government as a national anthem, but not the sole national anthem. This anthem is on equal status with “Kong Christian”, which is both the national and royal anthem, however “Derer et yndigt land” is heard more often in the country.  The original work has 12 verses, but only the first, third, fifth, and last verses are used as the national anthem.

When the Danish anthem is usually performed or sung, the first verse is played in its entirety, then it is followed by the last four lines of the last verse. (This is true whether the lyrics are sung or not.)

1. Der er et yndigt land,  
det står med brede bøge  
nær salten østerstrand;  
nær salten østerstrand; 
det bugter sig i bakke, dal,  
det hedder gamle Danmark,  
og det er Frejas Sal  
og det er Frejas Sal 
 
2. Der sad i fordums tid  
de harniskklædte kæmper,  
udhvilede fra strid;  
udhvilede fra strid;  
så drog de frem til fjenders mén  
nu hvile deres bene  
bag højens bautasten  
bag højens bautasten 
 
3. Det land endnu er skønt,  
thi blå sig søen bælter,  
og løvet står så grønt;  
og løvet står så grønt; 
og ædle kvinder, skønne mø’r  
og mænd og raske svende  
bebo de danskes øer  
bebo de danskes øer   
 
4. Hil drot og fædreland!  
Hil hver en danneborger,  
som virker, hvad han kan!  
som virker, hvad han kan! 
Vort gamle Danmark skal bestå,  
så længe bøgen spejler  
sin top i bølgen blå  
sin top i bølgen blå

1. I know a lovely land  
With spreading, shady beeches  
Near Baltic’s salty strand;  
Near Baltic’s salty strand;   
Its hills and valleys gently fall,  
Its ancient name is Denmark,  
And it is Freya’s hall  
And it is Freya’s hall   
 
2. There in the ancient days  
The armoured vikings rested  
Between their bloody frays  
Between their bloody frays  
Then they went forth the foe to face,  
Now found in stone-set barrows,  
Their final resting place  
Their final resting place   
 
3. This land is still as fair,  
The sea is blue around it,  
And peace is cherished there.  
And peace is cherished there.  
Strong men and noble women still  
Uphold their country’s honour  
With faithfulness and skill  
With faithfulness and skill   
 
4. Hail King and Fatherland
Hail every Danish person 
For doing what he can
For doing what he can 
The Viking land for Danes is true  
With fields and waving beeches  
By a sea so blue  
By a sea so blue

		<string>The flag of the Caribbean island Dominica, which has been adopted in November 1978, consists of a grass green leaf. A cross composed of three stripes (yellow, black and white) passes through the flag. In the middle of the cross, a national bird of Dominica (sisserou parrot royal ) in the red circle and surrounded by ten green stars is depicted . The stars represent ten communes of the island, yellow refers to the indigenous people and commodities typical of the island - bananas and citruses. Black stripe refers to the color of local residents and volcanic activity of the island, whereas white color traditionally stands for peace and crystal clear waters of the local rivers.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Adopted unofficially upon achieving statehood in 1967, the national song became the national anthem upon 1978 independence.

1. Isle of beauty, isle of splendor,
Isle to all so sweet and fair,
All must surely gaze in wonder
At thy gifts so rich and rare.
Rivers, valleys, hills and mountains,
All these gifts we do extol.
Healthy land, so like all fountains,
Giving cheer that warms the soul.

2. Dominica, God hath blest thee
With a clime benign and bright,
Pastures green and flowers of beauty
Filling all with pure delight,
And a people strong and healthy,
Full of godly, rev’rent fear.
May we ever seek to praise Thee
For these gifts so rich and rare.

3. Come ye forward, sons and daughters
Of this gem beyond compare.
Strive for honour, sons and daughters,
Do the right, be firm, be fair.
Toil with hearts and hands and voices.
We must prosper! Sound the call,
In which ev’ryone rejoices,
“All for Each and Each for All.”

		<string>The Dominican Republic shares the island Hispaniola with the state of Haiti. The entire island was under Spanish rule until 1804, when the French founded Haiti in the western third of the island. Dominican Republic achieved independence in 1844. The flag of the Dominican Republic is composed of relatively large white cross that divides the flag into four fields. Upper left field and the field along the diagonal line have blue color. The remaining two fields are red. In the middle of the cross, there is a coat of arms, which depicts a shield supported by palm and olive branch bearing an inscription: "Dios, Patria, Liberta", translated as "God, country, freedom."</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>José Reyés was inspired to make this anthem after noticing a published copy of the Argentine anthem. Reyés believed that his country should also have an anthem, so he invited his friend Emilio Prud’homme to write the lines while he composed the music. Soon after Reyés managed to get his anthem published as well; the first performance was on August 17, 1883, it was well-received by the public and soon grew in popularity.

A motion in the National Congress was made on June 7, 1897 by deputy Rafael Garcia Martinez to give the song official status, but the president refused to sign the bill into law, possibly because of Prud’homme’s disagreement with President Heureaux’s dictatorial government. It wasn’t until 1934, many years after Heureaux’s death, that President Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina officially adopted the song as the national anthem.

The anthem never refers to the nation or its people by the name “Dominican”, but rather uses the poetic term “Quisqueyano” throughout.  “Quisqueyano” is a reference to the original native inhabitants’ word for Hispaniola.

This is actually the third anthem used in the Dominican Republic.  The first, used from 1844 independence to 1885, was known as “Canción Dominicana”, and the second, used after that, did not appear to have a title.</string>

1. Quisqueyanos valientes, alcemos  
Nuestro canto con viva emoción,  
Y del mundo a la faz ostentemos  
Nuestro invicto, glorioso pendón.  
 
¡Salve! el pueblo que, intrépido y fuerte.  
A la guerra a morir se lanzó,  
cuando en bélico reto de muerte  
Sus cadenas de esclavo rompió.  
 
2. Ningún pueblo ser libre merece  
Si es esclavo, indolente y servil;  
Si en su pecho la llama no crece  
Que templó el heroísmo viril.  
 
Mas Quisqueya la indómita y brava  
Siempre altiva la frente alzará;  
Que si fuere vil veces esclava  
Otras tantas ser libre sabrá.  
 
3. Que si dolo y ardid la expusieron  
De un intruso señor al desdén,  
¡Las Carreras! ¡Beler!  Campos fueron  
Que cubiertos de gloria se ven.  
 
Que en la cima de heroíco baluarte,  
De los libres el verbo encarnó,  
Donde el genio de Sánchez y Duarte  
A ser libre o morir enseñó.  
 
4. Y si pudo inconsulto caudillo  
De esas glorias el brillo empañar,  
De la guerra se vió en Capotillo  
La bandera de fuego ondear.  
 
Y el incendio que atónito deja  
De Castilla al soberbio león,  
De las playas gloriosas le aleja  
Donde flota el cruzado pendón.  
 
5. Compatriotas, mostremos erguida  
Nuestra frente, orgullosos de hoy más;  
Que Quisqueya será destruida  
Pero sierva de nuevo, jamás.  
 
Que es santuario de amor cada pecho  
De la patria se siente vivir;  
Y es su escudo invencible, el derecho;  
Y es su lema: ser libre o morir.  
 
6. Libertad que aún se yergue serena  
La victoria en su carro triunfal,  
Y el clarín de la guerra aún resuena  
Pregonando su gloria inmortal.  
 
¡Libertad! Que los ecos se agiten  
Mientras llenos de noble ansiedad  
Nuestros campos de gloria repiten  
¡Libertad! ¡Libertad! ¡Libertad!

1. Valients of Quisqueya,
Let us sing with strong feeling
And let us show to the world
Our invincible, glorious banner.
 
Hail, O people who, strong and intrepid,
Launched into war and went to death!
Under a warlike menace of death,
You broke your chains of slavery.
 
2. No country deserves to be free
If it is an indolent and servile slave,
If the call does not grow loud within it,
Tempered by a virile heroism.
 
But the brave and indomitable Quisqueya
Will always hold its head high,
For if it were a thousand times enslaved,
It would a thousand times regain liberty.
 
3. If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit
Unto contempt of a real imposer,
On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were places
Where the traces of glory are found.
 
Where on the top of the heroic bastion,
The word of the libarated became flesh,
Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte
Taught to be free or to die.
 
4. And if an unattended leader the splendor
Of these glorious events could ignore,
One has seen in Capotillo in the war
The flag of fire wave.
 
And the fire that lets the proud lion
Of Castilla become stupefied,
Removes him from the glorious beaches
Where the crossed banner waves.
 
5. Compatriots, let us proudly
Show our face, from today prouder than ever;
Quisqueya may be destroyed
But a slave again, never!
 
It is a sanctuary of love that every character
Of the fatherland feels alive!
And it is his coat of arms, the right;
And it is his device: be free or die.
 
6. Liberty that still rises cool-bloodedly
The victory in her triumphal car.
And the clarion of war re-echoes
Proclaiming his immortal glory.
 
Liberty! That the echo’s touch
While they’re full of noble tension
Our fields of glory repeat
Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!

		<string>The flag of Algeria consists of two stripes of equal width that have green and white color. At the borderline of the stripes, a red crescent surrounding a five-pointed star is placed. The flag has been used since 1962 when Algeria gained its independence, and it has been inspired by the flag of National Liberation Front. Green color traditionally represents Islam and white color stands for purity. The crescent is taken over from the Turkish flag and it is associated with Islam as well. A white flag was a symbol of national hero Abd al-Qadir, who became famous for the leadership of the resistance against the French rule in the 19th century. The red color of the star and crescent refers to the blood shed during these fights.</string>

		<string>The words to “Qassaman” were written in 1956 in Serkaji-Barberousse Prison in Algiers, where the author Moufdi Zakaria was incarcerated by the French colonial forces. The poem was put into music, first by Mohamed Triki in 1956, then by the Egyptian composer Mohamed Fawzi and became the national anthem upon independence on July 5th, 1962. The anti-French sentiments of the third verse result in this verse occasionally being left out of performances, however the verse remains an official part of the text.</string>

و عقدنا العزم أن تحيا الجزائر

يا فرنسا قد مضى وقت العتاب

فاستعدي و خذي منا الجواب
ان في ثورتنا فصل الخطاب
و عقدنا العزم ان تحيى الجزائر
فاشهدوا… فاشهدوا… فاشهدوا…

نحن من أبطالنا ندفع جندا
و على أشلائنا نصنع مجدا
و على أرواحنا نصعد خلدا
و على هاماتنا نرفع بندا
جبهة التحرير أعطيناك عهدا
و عقدنا العزم أن تحيا الجزائر
فاشهدوا… فاشهدوا… فاشهدوا…

صرخة الأوطان من ساح الفدا
فاسمعوها و استجيبوا للندا
و اكتبوها بدماء الشهدا
و اقرأوها لبني الجيل غدا
قد مددنا لك يا مجد يدا
و عقدنا العزم أن تحيا الجزائر
فاشهدوا… فاشهدوا… فاشهدوا…

1. We swear by the lightning that destroys,
By the streams of generous blood being shed,
By the bright flags that wave,
Flying proudly on the high djebels,
That we are in revolt, whether to live or to die,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

2. We are soldiers in revolt for truth
And we have fought for our independence.
When we spoke, nobody listened to us,
So we have taken the noise of gunpowder as our rhythm
And the sound of machine guns as our melody,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

3. O France, the time of reproof is over
And we have ended it as a book is ended;
O France, this is the day of reckoning
So prepare to receive from us our answer!
In our revolution is the end of empty talk;
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

4. From our heroes we shall make an army come to being,
From our dead we shall build up a glory,
Our spirits shall ascend to immortality
And on our shoulders we shall raise the Standard.
To the nation’s Liberation Front we have sworn an oath,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

5. The cry of the Fatherland sounds from the battlefields.
Listen to it and answer the call!
Let it be written with the blood of martyrs
And be read to future generations.
Oh, Glory, we have held out our hand to you,
We are determined that Algeria should live,
So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!

		<string>The flag of Ecuador, which was adopted in 1960, consists of three horizontal stripes of yellow, blue, and red color in the ratio 2:1:1. Until 1833 Ecuador was a part of so called Gran Colombia along with Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela. Therefore, the colors of the flag refer to the colors used on the flags of all fromer members of this federation. Another interpretation says that the yellow and red refer to Spain and the blue color stands for the ocean separating the country from Spain. Allegedly, the flag was designed by the leader of the resistance against Spanish domination general Francisco de Miranda. The coat of arms in the middle of the flag, which is often omitted, displays the Andean condor prepared to defeat any enemy and to protect the Ecuadorian nation under his wings.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Ecuador’s anthem is another example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. The lyrics were written in 1865 (the author, Juan León Mera, later served as president of the Ecuadoran senate) and set to music the following year. Except in formal occassions (where the second verse is performed, followed by the third verse and the the second verse is repeated), the second verse is the verse that’s sung out of the seven verses of the poem (six of which make up the complete lyrics of the anthem.)

CHORUS:
¡Salve, Oh Patria, mil veces! ¡Oh Patria, 
gloria a ti! Ya tu pecho rebosa 
gozo y paz, y tu frente radiosa 
más que el sol contemplamos lucir.

1. Indignados tus hijos del yugo
que te impuso la ibérica audacia,
de la injusta y horrenda desgracia
que pesaba fatal sobre ti,
santa voz a los cielos alzaron,
voz de noble y sin par juramento,
de vengarte del monstruo sangriento,
de romper ese yugo servil.
Chorus
 
2. Los primeros los hijos del suelo
que, soberbio, el Pichincha decora
te aclamaron por siempre señora
y vertieron su sangre por ti.
Dios miró y aceptó el holocausto,
y esa sangre fue germen fecundo
de otros héroes que, atónito el mundo
vio en tu torno a millares surgir.
Chorus
 
3. De esos héroes al brazo de hierro
nada tuvo invencible la tierra,
y del valle a la altísima sierra
se escuchaba el fragor de la lid;
tras la lid la victoria volaba,
libertad tras el triunfo venía,
y al león destrozado se oía
de impotencia y despecho rugir.
Chorus
 
4. Cedió al fin la fiereza española,
y hoy, ¡oh Patria!, tu libre existencia
es la noble y magnífica herencia
que nos dio el heroísmo feliz:
de las manos paternas la hubimos,
nadie intente arrancárnosla ahora,
ni nuestra ira excitar vengadora
quiera, necio o audaz, contra sí.
Chorus
 
5. Nadie, oh Patria, lo intente. Las sombras
de tus héroes gloriosos nos miran,
y el valor y el orgullo que inspiran
son augurios de triunfos por ti.
Venga el hierro y el plomo fulmíneo,
que a la idea de guerra y venganza
se despierta la heroica pujanza
que hizo al fiero español sucumbir.
Chorus
 
6. Y si nuevas cadenas prepara
la injusticia de bárbara suerte,
¡gran Pichincha! prevén tú la muerte
de la Patria y sus hijos al fin;
hunde al punto en tus hondas entrañas
cuanto existe en tu tierra, el tirano
huelle sólo cenizas y en vano
busque rastro de ser junto a ti.

CHORUS:
O homeland, we greet you a thousand times!
Glory be to you, O homeland, glory be to you!
Your breast overflows with joy and peace,
And we see your radiant face shining
More brightly than the sun.
 
2. The worthy sons of the soil
Which Pichincha on high is adorning,
Always acclaimed you as sovereign lady
And shed their blood for you.
God observed and accepted the sacrifice,
And that blood was the prolific seed
Of other heroes whom the world in astonishment saw
Arising in thousands around you.
Chorus
 
3. For these steel armed heroes   
Nothing in the land was invincible   
And from the valley to the high Sierra   
Could the clamour of the struggle be heard;  
After the struggle, victory came flying.   
And freedom followed on victory’s heel.   
And the toppled lion could be heard,   
As it roared in impotence and vanity.

		<string>The flag of Estonia consists of a horizontal tricolor of cornflower blue, black, and white color. For the first time, it appeared in 1881 as a symbol of the student movement Vironia in Otepää. The blue color represents the Estonian sea, sky and lakes and sometimes it is also considered a symbol of honesty. Black should commemorate sorrows of the Estonian population but it also refers to the traditional black vest of local farmers. White indicates snow, which covers Estonian soil for a large part of the year, and it also expresses the desire for freedom.

		<string>Estonia’s anthem shares the same melody as the anthem of Finland, with whom they share a similar culture, and was adopted in 1869, several decades before early twentieth century independence (and about 20 years after the anthem was adopted by Finland). 

During the Soviet occupation period, it was illegal to sing “Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm”, however Estonians near enough to Finland to listen to broadcasts from that country were able to listen to the melody of the anthem that way, and thus the anthem stayed in the public consciousness.

There has been discussion about replacing the anthem with an original Estonian work, but generally the two nations have been content to share a melody.

		<string>The Egyptian flag consists of three horizontal stripes - red, white, and black one. In the middle of the white stripe, so called Saladin´s eagle is placed. It is a national symbol of Egypt and it refers to Arabic identity and independence. Saladin has become the Egyptian national hero when he managed to defeat the Crusaders and regain the city of Jerusalem in the 12th century. The eagle stares toward the left side of the flag and he holds a shield composed of three parts on his chest where two are black and one is yellow. The panel beneath the eagle bears an inscription "al-gumhuríja Misr al-Arabiya", which means the “Arab Republic of Egypt”. Interpretation of the tricolor is as follows: red refers to bloodshed in numerous wars, white to abolition of the monarchy and black should commemorate the monarchy and the period of British colonialism.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>After the 1979 signing of the peace accord with Israel, Egypt adopted a new, more peace-oriented national anthem.The music was composed by Sayed Darwish, a pioneer of Arabic music and a leader of the modern Egyptian renaissance at the turn of the 20th century. He also maintained close ties with early leaders of the national movement for independence in the Middle East, such as Mustapha Kamel. In fact, the words of the chorus were derived from one of Kamel’s most famous speeches. The music was popular in Egypt, especially after the establishment of the republic, and was long considered an unofficial national anthem until it was officially decreed as such.

The anthem officially consists of three verses, but only the first verse is commonly sung, being both preceded and followed by the chorus.

		<string>The flag of Eritrea, an African country situated on the Red Sea coast, has been adopted in 1995. It consists of three triangles of different colors, where the largest and red isosceles triangle forms a base for the pole side of the flag. The other two - a green on the top and blue at the bottom, are orthogonal and thus complete the rectangular shape of the flag. In the red field, an olive branch surrounded by a wreath of olive leaves is located. The color red symbolizes blood shed during the liberation struggles, blue represents the ocean and green is to remind agricultural tradition in the country. The olive branch has been inspired by the former flag that was designed as a honor to the United Nations.</string>

		<string>The design of the Spanish flag was changed many times, especially during the times of Spanish expansionist policy in the 16th and 17th century. However, the red and yellow colors remained unchanged. Currently, the flag has three horizontal stripes where the top one and the bottom one are red and the wider middle stripe is yellow. In the left upper part, the national coat of arms is located. Its fields represent Castile, Leon, Aragon, Navarre, and Grenada. Hercules columns on the sides of the coat of arms symbolize Gibraltar and Ceuta. The inscription "Plus Ultra" on a red ribbon wrapped around the columns has been used since the discovery of America and indicates that unlike the original conviction, there is more land in the west direction from Gibraltar.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem first appeared in a book of military bugle calls dating from 1761, known as the “Marcha Granadera”. In 1770 King Carlos III declared it as the official “honour march”, and was played at events attended by the royal family. It was then soon known as the “Marcha Real”.  The origin of the melody is in dispute. Researchers have claimed that it originated in parts of Europe outside Spain (such as France and Germany), and indeed the music is not typical of Spanish music.

In 1870, there was a contest held to have a new national anthem, but no winner was declared and the “Marcha Real” (as it is commonly known) remained as Spain’s anthem. After the anthem was replaced by the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War with “Himno Riego“, the victorious monarchist forces restored the “Marcha Real” by a decree from General Franco in July 1942.  Upon the restoration of the monarchy after Franco’s death in 1975, the name of the anthem was changed to simply “Himno Nacional Español”, perhaps to stress that the anthem belonged to the entire nation, rather than just the king. In 1997 the royal family issued a decree regulating the official use of the anthem.  Among other things, a long version (in the sidebar on the right) and a short version (without the section repeats) were decreed, the long version is to be used for the King , the short version is for the Prince, the Prime Minister, or to be performed for sporting events or other events of the like.

There have been many attempts to compose lyrics for the anthem; one set of lyrics by Eduardo Marquina was often heard during the reign of Alphons XIII (1886-1931), and lyrics which were common during Franco’s dictatorship (1939-1975); neither of these were official in their respective time periods, and have not been made official since then, due to their association with the dictatorships of Primo de Rivera and Franco respectively.</string>

		<string>The origin of the color base of the flag of Ethiopia is shrouded in mystery. One possible interpretation says that the colors green, yellow and red are referring to the colors of the rainbow, which is not unusual phenomenon in Ethiopia at all - it can be found at the waterfalls on the Blue Nile almost permanently. The apparent resemblance to the flag of Bolivia is most likely just a coincidence. Since Ethiopia is the oldest sovereign state in Africa, the tricolor was later adopted by a number of newly emerging countries with reference to this fact. Moreover, the flag of Ethiopia carries a national emblem that has been added in 1996 and which shows a yellow pentagram with five rays located in a blue circle. This symbol is to remind that all Ethiopians stands equal.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>After the communist government was replaced in 1992, the current anthem was adopted.  The General Provision to the Ethiopian Constitution says that the anthem “shall reflect the ideals of the Constitution, the Commitment of the Peoples of Ethiopia to live together in a democratic order and of their common destiny.”</string>

In equality and in love we stand united.

Wonderful is the stage of tradition, mistress of proud heritage,
Mother of natural virtue, mother of a valorous people.
We shall protect you – we have a duty;

		<string>The Finnish flag, also known as Siniristilippu (blue cross), is another of flags inspired by Danish Danneborg. Blue Nordic cross reaches the edges of the flag and it is located on a white background. The shorter arm of the cross is shifted closer to left side of the flag, like in case of other Scandinavian flags, but the cross is more massive compared to the others. Blue symbolizes thousands of Finnish lakes and white stands for snowy landscape. The cross is said to originate in old Nordic legends, however official Finnish version says that this cross was adopted after gaining the independence at the end of WW1. The state flag differs only by the national emblem which is placed in the center of the cross.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem lyrics were taken from a poem by Johan Ludvig Runeberg, a Swedish-speaking poet, called “Vårt land” (Our Land). The song was first sung in 1848 by a student group and became popular in Scandinavia and many of his patriotic poems, including Vårt land were used by promoters of Finnish nationalism. The poem was translated into Finnish some decades later, after Vårt land was well established as a national song, by Paavo Eemil Kajander and became the anthem before 1917 independence.

Estonia‘s anthem, adopted 20 years later, has the same melody, however the last few lines do not repeat as they do normally in the Finnish anthem.

Interestingly, the anthem has never been officially legislated as the Finnish anthem, but rather is traditionally used as the anthem.  As such, there is no standard way to perform the 11-verse anthem, but usually the first and the last verses (as presented here) are sung.

There sometimes arises a debate in Finland to change the anthem to Jean Sibelius’ song “Finlandia” (the melody was used in Biafra), a song recognized internationally as a symbol of Finland, but the general opinion seems to be for now to keep the current anthem. (One reason may be that Finlandia is harder to sing compared to Maamme.)

		<string>At the first glance at the flag of Fiji, it is evident that this island nation used to be under British rule. The flag has been adopted after gaining independence in 1970 and it consists of a pale blue leaf and a miniature of Union Jack flag in the upper left field. In addition, the flag bears national coat of arms where a yellow lion holding a cocoa bean and St. George's Cross are depicted. The resulting fields bear pictures of sugarcane, coconut palm, white turtledove carrying an olive branch in its beak, and bunch of bananas. These commodities are typical of Fiji since it was not imported on the islands. The light blue color of the leaf should remind the Pacific Ocean which surrounds Fiji.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The melody of “God Bless Fiji” was adapted from a hymn by C. Austin Miles entitled “Dwelling in Beulah Land”. The lyrics were then written by Michael Francis Alexander Prescott to the tune and won first prize in a nationwide contest before independence in October 1970.

The Fijian words, while official, are rarely sung, the English version is much more common. The English and Fijian lyrics are also different in meaning, the lyrics on this page give both the official English lyrics and the English translation of the Fijian lyrics, as well as the Fijian lyrics themselves.  The third most common ethnic group on the islands are Indo-Fijians and it was proposed in 2008 that the national anthem be in the three primary languages of the country:  English, Fijian, and Hindi.

1. Let us show pride and honour our nation
Where righteous people reside
Where prosperity and fellowship may persevere
Abandon deeds that are immoral

CHORUS: 

Let Fiji live on
And progress onwards
May our leaders be honourable men
Let them lead our people
To great things
And bring an end to all things immoral

2. The burden of change lie on your shoulders youth of Fiji
Be the strength to cleanse our nation
Be wary and not harbour malice
For we must abandon such sentiments forever

		<string>The flag of the Federated States of Micronesia, which has been adopted on 10 November 1979, consists of a pale blue leaf on which four white five-pointed stars are placed. Since Micronesia is a grouping of islands located in the Pacific Ocean, bright blue background represents the ocean that surrounds the islands. The four main islands (and federated states) called Chuuk, Pohnpei, Yap and Kusrae are represented through the stars. Originally, the flag of Micronesia was carrying six stars, but after the departure of the Marshall Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands from the Federation two stars were removed. Flags of similar character are typical of number of states in Oceania.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The music for this anthem (also known as “Across All Micronesia”, presumably from a line in the second verse) is adapted from the German patriotic song “Ich hab mich ergeben” (which was also the West German national anthem from 1949-1950), variants of this tune are used in Johannes Brahms’ “Festival Overture” and Gustav Mahler’s Third Symphony). The tune predates both of these, it can be dated to around 1820. The lyrics also somewhat resemble “Ich hab mich ergeben”, which suggests that the writers of the anthem were well aware of the German work. (Micronesia was once a German protectorate, before it was controlled by the Japanese and then the Americans, but it is unclear if this has anything to do with it.)

		<string>The traditional French red-blue-white tricolor became a symbol of freedom during the French Revolution in the late 18th century. These colors were decorating roundels of revolutionists and the tricolor was carried in 1789 during the conquest of the Bastille, when political prisoners held by the old regime were freed. This day is considered to be the beginning of the French Revolution, and the tricolor remained in the minds of Frenchmen associated with the creation of modern French Republic. All three stripes on the flag are displayed vertically and have the same width. The blue stripe is located on the left side of the flag, white in the middle, and the red one on the right side.</string>

		<string>“La Marseillaise” was written and composed by Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle, captain in the Engineering corps garrisoned in Strasbourg during the night of 24 to 25 April 1792 at the behest of the city’s mayor, Baron de Dietrich. The song, originally entitled Hymne de Guerre Dédié au Maréchal de Luckner, became known as Chant de Guerre pour l’Armée du Rhin when it was adopted as the marching song of the National Guard of Marseille. The Marseille troops were singing it as they entered Paris on 30 July 1792, and the Parisians dubbed it the Marseillaise. The anthem is probably the first example of the “European march” style of anthem.

During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, “La Marseillaise” was also known as the anthem of the international revolutionary movement. In 1871, it was the anthem of the Paris Commune, and many later anarchists took inspiration from the Commune. After the fall of the Czarist government in Russia, when Communism was just starting to be set up, the melody of “La Marseillaise” was used (with different words) by radical socialists during the era of the Provisional Government, until “The Internationale” gained more popularity, and started to replace “La Marseillaise” as the anthem of leftist revolutionaries.

Under the First Republic, “La Marseillaise” was one of the civic songs that contributed to the success of the Revolution, and thus was given official status (along with “Chœur de la Liberté”, with words by Voltaire). However, it has not been continuously used since the Revolution; both Empires, the Restoration and the Second Republic passed over it in favour of other songs, with links above. During these times, however, “La Marseillaise” still remained quite popular with the people, especially the republicans, these other anthems were created in an attempt to quell the popularity of “La Marseillaise” (especially during the times of the restored monarchy and empire, when a republican government was against the aims of the current governmental type.)

Not until the Third Republic was the Marseillaise restored to its rank of national anthem on all occasions at which military bands were called upon to play an official air.  daniel start   After the fall of the Third Republic and the occupation of northern France by Germany, the Marseillaise remained the official anthem of both the Vichy government (the Nazi puppet state set up in unoccupied southern France) and the Free France forces, who were against the Vichy government and sought its removal.  Both factions also had unofficial anthems in popular use as well, the Vichy government used a song dating from 1847 entitled “Maréchal, nous voilà!” (written and composed by André Montagard and co-composer Charles Courtious), and the Free French “Le Chant des Partisans” composed by Anna Marly (music) and French words by  Maurice Druon and Joseph Kessel daniel end , customarily sung as the anthem. The Marseillaise was made the official national anthem by the constitutions of the Fourth and Fifth Republics (Article 2 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958). In 1974, President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing had it modified in accordance with earlier scores and slowed the tempo. Since 1981 however, the anthem has once again been performed according to the scores and tempo in use until 1974. While there are seven verses of the song, only the first (and sometimes the sixth and seventh) are sung, along with the chorus.

The lyrics, speaking of bloody battles and a call for citizens to take up arms, have been debated endlessly whether to alter the words to suit the more peaceful times that France currently enjoys, but the original words, capturing the spirit of the French revolution, remain. This is probably due to the fact that “La Marseillaise” is now inexorably linked to France in the mind of the world.

The anthem has become one of the most recognized in the world. Tchaikovsky used a piece of it in his “1812 Overture”, which was a chronicle of the war between Russia and France of that year. (The Russian “God Save the Czar” was also used in his work, but, interestingly, neither anthem was used as the national anthem in 1812! They were, however, both used as the respective countries’ national anthems in 1882, which was when the piece was written.) Also, until the adoption of “The Internationale” in Russia around 1918 as the Russian (later Soviet) national anthem, “La Marseillaise” was used by many communist, socialist, and left-leaning groups as an anthem.

1. Allons enfants de la Patrie,
Le jour de gloire est arrivé!
Contre nous de la tyrannie,
L’étendard sanglant est levé! 
L’étendard sanglant est levé! 
Entendez-vous dans les campagnes
Mugir ces féroces soldats?
Ils viennent jusque dans nos bras
Egorger nos fils et nos compagnes!

CHORUS:
Aux armes, citoyens!
Formez vos bataillons!
Marchons! marchons!
Qu’un sang impur
Abreuve nos sillons!

2. Que veut cette horde d’esclaves,
De traîtres, de rois conjurés?
Pour qui ces ignobles entraves,
Ces fers dès longtemps préparés? 
Ces fers dès longtemps préparés? 
Français, pour nous, ah! quel outrage!
Quels transports il doit exciter!
C’est nous qu’on ose méditer
De rendre à l’antique esclavage!

Chorus

3. Quoi ! ces cohortes étrangères
Feraient la loi dans nos foyers!
Quoi ! ces phalanges mercenaires
Terrasseraient nos fiers guerriers! 
Terrasseraient nos fiers guerriers! 
Grand Dieu ! par des mains enchaînées
Nos fronts sous le joug se ploieraient!
De vils despotes deviendraient
Les maîtres de nos destinées!

Chorus

4. Tremblez, tyrans et vous perfides,
L’opprobre de tous les partis,
Tremblez ! vos projets parricides
Vont enfin recevoir leurs prix! 
Vont enfin recevoir leurs prix! 
Tout est soldat pour vous combattre,
S’ils tombent, nos jeunes héros,
La terre en produit de nouveaux,
Contre vous tout prêts à se battre!

Chorus

5. Français, en guerriers magnanimes,
Portez ou retenez vos coups!
Epargnez ces tristes victimes,
A regret s’armant contre nous. 
A regret s’armant contre nous. 
Mais ces despotes sanguinaires,
Mais ces complices de Bouillé,
Tous ces tigres qui, sans pitié,
Déchirent le sein de leur mère!

Chorus

6. Amour sacré de la Patrie,
Conduis, soutiens nos bras vengeurs!
Liberté, Liberté chérie,
Combats avec tes défenseurs! 
Combats avec tes défenseurs! 
Sous nos drapeaux, que la victoire
Accoure à tes mâles accents!
Que tes ennemis expirants
Voient ton triomphe et notre gloire !

Chorus

7. Nous entrerons dans la carrière
Quand nos aînés n’y seront plus; 
Nous y trouverons leur poussière
Et la trace de leurs vertus. 
Et la trace de leurs vertus. 
Bien moins jaloux de leur survivre
Que de partager leur cercueil,
Nous aurons le sublime orgueil
De les venger ou de les suivre !

1. Arise children of the fatherland
The day of glory has arrived
Against us tyranny’s
Bloody standard is raised
The bloody standard is raised
Listen to the sound in the fields
The howling of these fearsome soldiers
They are coming into our midst
To cut the throats of your sons and consorts

CHORUS:
To arms citizens
Form you battalions
March, march
Let impure blood
Water our furrows

2. What do they want this horde of slaves
Of traitors and conspiratorial kings?
For whom these vile chains
These long-prepared irons?
These long-prepared irons?
Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrage
What methods must be taken?
It is we they dare plan
To return to the old slavery!

Chorus

3. What! These foreign cohorts!
They would make laws in our courts!
What! These mercenary phalanxes
Would cut down our warrior sons
Cut down our warrior sons
Good Lord! By chained hands
Our brow would yield under the yoke
The vile despots would have themselves be
The masters of destiny

Chorus

4. Tremble, tyrants and traitors
The shame of all good men
Tremble! Your parricidal schemes
Will receive their just reward
Will receive their just reward
Against you we are all soldiers
If they fall, our young heros
France will bear new ones
Ready to join the fight against you

Chorus

5. Frenchmen, as magnanimous warriors
Bear or hold back your blows
Spare these sad victims
Who with regret are taking up arms against us
With regret are taking up arms against us
But not these bloody despots
These accomplices of Bouillé
All these tigers who pitilessly
Are ripping open their mothers’ breasts

Chorus

6. Sacred Love for the Fatherland
Lead and support our avenging arms
Liberty, cherished liberty
Join the struggle with your defenders
Join the struggle with your defenders
Under our flags, let victory
Hasten to you virile force
So that in death your enemies
See your triumph and our glory!

Chorus

7. We shall enter into the pit
When our elders will no longer be there
There we shall find their ashes
And the mark of their virtues
And the mark of their virtues
We are much less jealous of surviving them
Than of sharing their coffins
We shall have the sublime pride
Of avenging or joining them

		<string>The current flag of Gabon has been adopted in 1960 when the country declared independence from France, and it is composed of three horizontal stripes from the top in green, yellow and blue colors. The flag should express solidarity with other independent African states - the first two bands were taken from the flag of Etiopia, but also referes to formes ties to France as Gabon´s colonizer (blue bar). Green stripe symbolizes the Gabonese forest and timber industry, yellow stripe stands for the local sharp sun and the zero parallel, which passes through the country. Blue bar represents the Atlantic Ocean, which washes the western shores of the country, as well as all waters of the country, especially the river Ogooué.</string>

		<string>Adopted upon independence in 1960, “La Concorde” was written and composed by Georges Aleka Damas. Damas had held many diplomatic posts in Gabon since the mid 1940s, and was actively involved in politics and in the formation of labour unions.</string>

Come for us at last, rejoicing our hearts, 
And banish the sorcerers, those perfidious deceivers

The immortal Gabon may maintain her good repute, 
Let us forget our quarrels, let us build together 
The new structure of which we all have dreamed.

Let us remain vigilant, without weakness and without hatred! 
Around this flag which leads us to honour, 
Let us salute the Fatherland and ever sing!

		<string>Flag of the United Kingdom - also known to the British as a Union Jack, has been used since 1603 when the Scottish King James VI became the king of England. The symbolism of the flag expresses the linkage between England, Scotland, and Wales. The central theme is a red cross of St. George, who is considered to be the patron of England. The cross is fringed by wider white cross and everything is set in a blue background. The white diagonal cross should remind of St. Andrew, the patron of Scotland. Ireland is represented by a red diagonal cross, which is the symbol of the Irish patron St. Patrick. The Irish cross has not been added until 1801, when Ireland became a member of the United Kingdom. Union Jack motif can be found on many flags as a reminder of Britain's past as a colonial power.</string>

		<string>“God Save the Queen” (or “God Save the King”, depending on the gender of the ruling monarch) was first publicly performed in London in 1745 to support King George II after he was defeated in a battle in the Jacobean uprising that started that year.  The song was used to boost morale and the forces loyal to George II would go on to defeat the Jacobites the following year. The song came to be referred to as the national anthem from the beginning of the nineteenth century. 

The words and tune are anonymous, and may date back to the seventeenth century. There are various claimants to authorship of both the words and tune, the words can be found as early as 1545, when the watchword at night was “God save the King”, the reply was “Long to reign over us.” The authorship of the melody has been claimed by many, including John Bull (the author of the earliest piece of music that resembles the work), Henry Carey, Henry Purcell, and Joseph Haydn (although he probably borrowed the tune upon hearing it in London.)

There is no authorised version of the National Anthem as the words are a matter of tradition.  The anthem has also never been officially declared as the national anthem of the country, the royal anthem (as this technically is) is used as the national anthem as a matter of tradition, but this is also due to the unique constitutional situation in the United Kingdom, as the nation doesn’t have a formal constitution. The words used are those sung in 1745, substituting ‘Queen’ for ‘King’ (and female pronouns with male ones) where appropriate. On official (and most other) occassions, the first verse only is sung, on a small number of occassions, the third verse is heard as well; very rarely is the second verse heard due to its militaristic nature. There exist many other verses, some dating as far back as the first three verses, but the first three are what can best be represented as the “standard” British national anthem.

The British tune has since become one of the world’s most recognizable anthems, and has has been used in other countries – as European visitors to Britain in the eighteenth century noticed the advantage of a country possessing such a recognised musical symbol – including Germany, Russia, Switzerland, the United States (where use of the tune continued after independence as the patriotic song “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” and one of several unofficial anthems before 1931), and even today by Liechtenstein and as the royal anthem of Norway. The song also was an influence on early anthems used in the Kingdom of Hawaii.  (One might say that because of this fact, that the United Kingdom was the creator of the concept of a “national anthem”.) Some 140 composers, including Beethoven, Haydn and Brahms, have used the tune in their compositions.

“God Save the Queen” also serves as the royal anthem for most Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and Canada. (Governors-general of Commonwealth countries usually have bits and pieces of the national anthem strung together played as their anthem.)

		<string>The flag of Grenada, which has been adopted after gaining the independence in 1974, is considered one of the most remarkable flags. The sheet is framed by a red stripe with three yellow five-pointed stars on the top and at the bottom. The central part is divided by two diagonal lines into four fields from which the left and the right fields are green and the upper and the lower fields are yellow. In the center of the flag, there is a seventh star in a red circle. In the left green field, a nutmeg, typical commodity of the island, is displayed. The colorfulness of the flag reflects the vitality of the local population and the central star represents the capital Saint George's. Another six stars stand for six administrative districts of the island.</string>

		<string>“Hail Grenada” has been this Caribbean isle’s anthem since independence in 1974.  The words of the national motto, “Ever Conscious of God We Aspire, Build and Advance as One People”, appear in the lyrics.

		<string>The flag of Georgia was adopted in January 2004 after the so-called "Rose Revolution", therefore it is one of the newest flags. At that time, it was a symbol of the National Movement of newly elected President Saakashvili. It consists of large red St. George cross that reaches the edges of the flag, and four smaller red crosses placed in the middle of each of the resulting fields. The origin of the flag dates back to the 14th century, when an unknown Franciscan monk mentioned the "white-colored veil with five red crosses." The cross is also similar to the cross of Jerusalem, which was used by the conquerors of the Holy Land during a period when many monasteries were founded in Georgia as a demonstration of their faith.</string>

		<string>On April 23, 2004, a few months after a popular revolt replaced the government and altered the national symbols, a new national anthem was adopted. The music was taken from the Georgian operas “Abesalom da Eteri” and “Daisi” by the Georgian composer Zakaria Paliashvili, and were composed into an anthem by Joseb Ketschakmadse.

Bright mounts and valleys

Today our freedom
Sings to the glory of future,
The dawn star rises up
And shines out between two seas.
Praise be to the liberty,

		<string>Ghana was the first African state that chose to use traditional Pan-African colors (red, yellow, and green) on its flag. It happened in 1957, when Ghana gained independent from Great Britain. The colors of the tricolor were inspired by the national colors of Ethiopia, which, as the first independent state, was a symbol of the struggle for freedom. Thus, the flag is composed of three horizontal stripes and black five-pointed star in the middle of the central yellow stripe. Allegedly, the star should refer to the shipping company Black Star Line, whose mission was to return the black population to its home continent. The red stripe recalls the blood shed during the struggle for freedom, the yellow stripe refers to the mineral wealth of the country, and the green one indicates the local lush forests and freedom.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The original words to this anthem, adopted upon independence in 1957 and written by the composer Philip Gbeho, were changed upon the declaration of a republic in 1960, and when the government was overthrown six years later, the current lyrics were adopted after a contest was held for new lyrics.

1. God bless our homeland Ghana
And make our nation great and strong,
Bold to defend forever
The cause of Freedom and of Right;
Fill our hearts with true humility,
Make us cherish fearless honesty,
And help us to resist oppressors’ rule
With all our will and might evermore. 
And help us to resist oppressors’ rule
With all our will and might evermore.

2. Hail to thy name, O Ghana,
To thee we make our solemn vow:
Steadfast to build together
A nation strong in Unity;
With our gifts of mind and strength of arm,
Whether night or day, in the midst of storm,
In ev’ry need, whate’er the call may be,
To serve thee, Ghana, now and evermore.
In ev’ry need, whate’er the call may be,
To serve thee, Ghana, now and evermore.

3. Raise high the flag of Ghana
And one with Africa advance;
Black star of hope and honor
To all who thirst for liberty;
Where the banner of Ghana free flies,
May the way to freedom truly lie;
Arise, arise, O sons of Ghanaland,
And under God march on for evermore!
Arise, arise, O sons of Ghanaland,
And under God march on for evermore!

		<string>Part of the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland has a local anthem adopted in 1916 well before autonomy. Since 1979, when home rule was granted, the government has also recognized the anthem used by the local Kalaallit people, “Nuna asiilasooq” (The Land of Great Length) as a secondary anthem.

		<string>The flag of Guinea has been adopted in 1958 when the country gained independence from France. As the flag would be exactly the same with the flag of Rwanda, Rwanda was forced to add capital letter R to the middle of the yellow stripe. The flag consists of a vertical tricolor which commemorates the French flag. The stripes have from the left red, yellow and green colors. These colors have traditional Pan-African character that symbolizes solidarity between independent African states. The symbolism of these colors was explained during the famous speech of president Séky Touré - red should commemorate the bloodshed in the struggle for the homeland, yellow symbolizes the mineral wealth of the country and the sun and the green stripe represent the lush African vegetation.</string>

		<string>Guinea’s anthem was adopted upon independence in 1958. The author of the lyrics are unknown, but the composer of the music was Fodeba Keita; the melody was possibly based on an old folk tune.

		<string>The flag of Equatorial Guinea, which has been adopted in 1979, consists of three horizontal stripes of green, white and red colors. On the pole side of the flag, a blue wedge is placed. In addition, the white stripe bears an emblem of the country depicting baobab which is a typical plant of Equatorial Guinea´s geographical location. Above the baobab, six golden stars shine thus representing five islands and continental part of the country. At the bottom of the coat of arms, there is an inscription: "Unity, peace, justice." The blue color of the wedge indicates the Pacific Ocean, green stands for jungle, white color traditionally symbolizes peace and red should remind blood shed during the struggle for independence.</string>

		<string>Used since independence, the music of the anthem was composed by a Spanish lieutenant and the deputy director of music at the army headquarters in Madrid (the capital of the former colonial power).

		<string>The Greek flag originated during the uprising against the Turks in 1821, when a blue flag with a white cross was raised in order to oppose the Ottoman crescent. The flag in its present form was adopted in 1822. The cross was moved to the top left part of the flag and white and blue stripes were added. Nine striped should probably remind nine syllables of a revolutionary slogan "Eleftheria i Thanatos" ("Freedom or Death"). Blue symbolizes the sea, whose beauty inspired the idea of revolt. White stands for purity of revolutionists´ intentions and cross refers to the respect to the Orthodox Church, which helped to maintain national identity in times of occupation. The shade of blue was changed many times, yet the flag can be called "Galanolefci" (blue and white in translation).</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The Greek Anthem is based on the “Hymn to the Freedom”, a large 158 verse poem written by Dionysios Solomos, a distinguished poet from Zakynthos Island. It was inspired by the Greek Revolution of 1821 against the Ottoman Empire. During 1828 Nikolaos Mantzaros composed the music for Solomos’ hymn, one version for the entire poem, and one for just the first two stanzas. Although King Othon (Otto) decorated both of them for their work (1845 and 1849), he did not replace the Royal Anthem of that time with the Solomos/Mantzaros hymn. The royal anthem then in use was a musical derivative from the German one, with a text glorifying Othon and his dynasty. After the overthrow of the dynasty, the new King George I and the Greek establishment decided to look for a clearly Greek work, both with respect to the poetry and the music. The “Hymn to the Freedom” was readily there – extremely popular since the Revolution times, often recited or sung during patriotic meetings and celebrations, and the “Hymn to Freedom” (with Mantzaro’s version for the first two stanzas only) became the national anthem.
            
            The Greek anthem is also used in Cyprus, which has a substantial Greek community.

		<string>The flag of Guatemala, which has been used in its current form since 1871, consists of three vertical stripes in blue, white and blue colors. In the middle of the white stripe, there is a national coat of arms that also dates from 1871. It depicts a national bird quetzal holding a scroll with an inscription "LIBERTAD DE 15 de Septiembre 1821" - this day Guatemala was freed from the Spanish rule. The emblem is bounded by a wreath and also by two rifles, which have to remind guerrilla war that did not end until 1996. The colors blue and white are common to all Central American countries, where two blue stripes represent the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, but also independence. The white color symbolizes peace.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Written in response to an 1887 contest calling for a national anthem to be adopted, the winning entry was not proclaimed until 1896, the first ever performance of the anthem took place during a lyric-literary meeting taking place at the Colon Theater, the night of Sunday 14 March 1897, as one of the main events of the Central American Exposition, and the author of the music was decorated with a gold medal and honor diploma. (Ovalle had been known previously for setting to music “Himno Popular” (The People’s Anthem) by the poet Ramón P. Molina. It is unclear whether the music used for Ovalle’s work was the same as the music that was submitted for the national anthem competition.)  The author of the lyrics, however, was submitted anonymously, it was not until 1911, when it was discovered that the author was the Cuban poet Jose Joaquin Palma, who on his deathbed was honored with a silver wreath placed on his head, while outside the public and the bands sang the Himno Nacional.

The original lyrics were modified slightly in 1934 by Professor Jose Maria Bonilla Ruano, a Spanish grammar scholar. Some verses were softened in their bloody context while others were enhanced in their poetic beauty.

The anthem has four verses (including four separate choruses at the end of each verse). Unlike many other nations with multi-verse anthems, all four verses are official and sung in Guatemala.  The anthem is sometimes erroneously called “¡Guatemala Feliz!” (Guatemala, Be Praised) from the opening words of the anthem, but officially there is no title and is simply referred to inside the country as “Himno Nacional”.

1. ¡Guatemala feliz! que tus aras
No profane jamás el verdugo;
Ni haya esclavos que laman el yugo
Ni tiranos que escupan tu faz.
 
Si mañana tu suelo sagrado
Lo amenaza invasión extranjera,
Libre al viento tu hermosa bandera
A vencer o a morir llamará.

CHORUS:
Libre al viento tu hermosa bandera
A vencer o a morir llamará.
Que tu pueblo con ánima fiera
Antes muerto que esclavo será.
 
2. De tus viejas y duras cadenas
Tú forjaste con mano iracunda
El arado que el suelo fecunda
Y la espada que salva el honor.
 
Nuestros padres lucharon un día
Encendidos en patrio ardimiento
Y lograron sin choque sangriento
Colocarte en un trono de amor,

CHORUS: 
Y lograron sin choque sangriento
Colocarte en un trono de amor,
Que de patria, en enérgico acento,
Dieron vida al ideal redentor.
 
3. Es tu enseña pedazo de cielo
En que prende una nube su albura,
Y ay de aquel que con ciega locura,
Sus colores pretenda manchar!
 
Pues tus hijos valientes y altivos,
Que veneran la paz cual presea,
Nunca esquivan la ruda pelea
Si defienden su tierra y su hogar,

CHORUS: 
Nunca esquivan la ruda pelea
Si defienden su tierra y su hogar,
Que es tan sólo el honor su alma idea
Y el altar de la patria su altar.
 
4. Recostada en el ande soberbio,
De dos mares al ruido sonoro,
Bajo el ala de grana y de oro
Te adormeces del bello quetzal.
 
Ave indiana que vive en tu escudo
Paladión que protege tu suelo;
¡Ojalá que remonte su vuelo,
Más que el cóndor y el águila real

CHORUS: 
¡Ojalá que remonte su vuelo,
Más que el cóndor y el águila real
Y en sus alas levante hasta el cielo,
Guatemala, tu nombre inmortal!

Never be profaned by cruel men.
May there never be slaves who submit to their yoke,
Or tyrants who deride you.

Should be threatened by foreign invasion,
Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,
Will call to you: Conquer or die.

CHORUS:
Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,
Will call to you: Conquer or die;
For your people, with heart and soul,
Would prefer death to slavery.

2. From your old and hard chains  
You forged, with an ire-driven hand,  
The plow that fertilizes the soil  
And the sword that saves honor.  
 
Our fathers fought one day,  
Lit up in patriotic burning  
And they were able, without bloody clash,  
To place you on a throne of love.  

CHORUS:
And they were able, without bloody clash,  
To place you on a throne of love,  
That our Nation, in energetic assent,  
Gave life to the ideal redeemer. 
 
3. Your emblem shows a piece of the sky  
In which a cloud gets its whiteness  
Wretched is he who dares in madness  
stain your colors  
 
Well, your brave and proud sons  
who admire the peace within  
will never avoid the rough battles  
if they are to defend their land and their home.  
 
CHORUS: 
They will never avoid the rough battles  
if they are to defend their land and their home  
that honor is the idea that reigns their souls  
and the altar of the mother country their altar 
 
4. Lying in the magnificent Andes  
with two oceans at hearing distance  
under the wing of seeds and gold  
you become entranced from the beautiful quetzal  
 
Native bird that lives in your seal  
protector that protects your soil  
hopefully he will fly high  
more than the condor and the royal eagle!  
 
CHORUS: 
Hopefully he will fly high  
more than the condor and the royal eagle  
and in his wings, raise up to the sky:  
Guatemala, your immortal name!

		<string>The flag of Guinea-Bissau has been adopted in 1973 and it consists of three stripes where two of them are horizontal and one is vertical. Horizontal stripes have yellow and green color, whereas the vertical one in the left part of the flag is red and it carries a black five-pointed star. The colors used are typical of many African nations, thus represents their mutual solidarity. Yellow reminds the sharp African sun, green fertile soil and red stands for bloodshed in the struggle for independence. The black star symbolizes the African continent. The flag resembles the flag of Ghana, the first African nation that achieved independence. Guinea-Bissau followed Ghana in 1973, when it was liberated from Portuguese rule.</string>

		<string>In 1963, a delegation from Portugese Guinea (as it was then known, as a Portugese colony) visited China. After hearing a song composed by Xiao He, one of the independentist politicians in attendance, Amilcar Lopes Cabral, said that he would like that composer to compose a similar song to inspire the people of Portugese Guinea to strive for independence. Using African music as his inspiration, Xiao He composed the music, which became the anthem of Guinea-Bissau upon 1974 independence.

Since Cabral’s organization included both Portugese Guinea and Cabo Verde, the anthem was also adopted by Cabo Verde when their independence was achieved a year later. The two nations even proposed to merge, but this merger dissolved before it was realized, and a few decades later, Cabo Verde subsequently adopted its own anthem.</string>

Made rich by the sunshine, and lush by the rains,
Set gem like and fair, between mountains and sea,
Your children salute you, dear land of the free. 

2. Green land of Guyana, our heroes of yore,
Both bondsmen and free, laid their bones on your shore.
This soil so they hallowed, and from them are we,
All sons of one Mother, Guyana the free.

3. Great land of Guyana, diverse though our strains,
We are born of their sacrifice, heirs of their pains,
And ours is the glory their eyes did not see,
One land of six peoples, united and free.

4. Dear land of Guyana, to you will we give,
Our homage, our service, each day that we live;
God guard you, great Mother, and make us to be
More worthy our heritage, land of the free.

		<string>The flag of Honduras is composed of three horizontal stripes where two are blue and a white one is placed in-between. The blue stripes denote the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. In the middle of the white stripe, a grouping of five blue five-pointed stars in the shape of the letter "X" is located. The stars are the remaining of the flag of the Federal Republic of Central America, whose member was Honduras together with El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. This union lasted seventeen years and the stars should express a wish to recreate the federation. Honduras has been for a long time dilapidating under the domination of several dictators, whose practices caused that Honduras currently belongs to one of the least developed states of Central America.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Before the current anthem was adopted in 1915, other patriotic songs were unofficially used in Honduras.  The current anthem is like many others in Latin America in that the music has an operatic, “epic” feel to it (the composer was born in Germany), and has many verses (in this case, seven), which schoolchildren are expected to memorize in its entirety as a way of learning the country’s history, even though the chorus and the last verse are usually only used on official occasions. As such, it can be classified as a “Latin American epic anthem”.

A unique aspect of the Honduran anthem, however, is that it chronicles the history of the country in its seven verses. The first verse describes the country as Christopher Columbus, the first European to land in Honduras, would have seen it. The second tells of how men “from a country where the sun rises” dreamt of Honduras and go out to seek it. Upon arrival, they find that a flag (Spain’s) has been placed there. The third verse chronicles the native population’s attempted resistance against the Spanish. The fourth speaks of the three centuries under Spanish rule, and how requests for change from the colonies, like Honduras, were unheeded; until one day when news of revolution in Europe reached the Americas. Verse 5 continues this thought, stating how the French revolution was a model for those in Honduras seeking redress from Spain. The next verse (verse six) chronicles the revolutions that occurred in the Spanish colonies in America, as one by one they gained liberation from Spain, including Honduras (as part of the Central American federation, at first.) The final verse is a cry to all Hondurans to defend the nation, even in death if necessary.

The chorus, sung after each verse and at the start of the anthem (if all verses are sung), or at the start and end of the anthem, with the last verse sandwiched between them (as is performed at official occassions) is a description of the flag and coat of arms of Honduras.</string>

CHORUS:
Tu bandera, tu bandera
Es un lampo de cielo
Por un bloque, por un bloque
De nieve cruzado;
Y se ven en su fondo sagrado
Cinco estrellas de pálido azul;
En tu emblema que mar rumoroso
Con sus ondas bravías escuda,
De un volcán, de un volcán
Tras la cima desnuda
Hay un astro, hay un astro
De nítida luz.

1. India, virgen y hermosa dormías
De tus mares al canto sonoro,
Cuando echada en tus cuencas de oro
El audaz navegante te halló;
Y al mirar tu belleza extasiado
Al influjo ideal de tu encanto,
La orla azul de tu espléndido manto
Con su beso de amor consagró.

Chorus

2. De un país donde el sol se levanta,
Mas allá del Atlante azulado,
Aquel hombre que te había soñado
Y en tu busca a la mar se lanzó.
Cuando erguiste la pálida frente,
En la viva ansiedad de tu anhelo,
Bajo el dombo gentil de tu cielo
Ya flotaba un extraño pendón.

Chorus

3. Era inutil que el indio tu amado
Se aprestara a la lucha con ira,
Porque envuelto en su sangre Lempira,
En la noche profunda se hundió;
Y de la épica hazaña, en memoria,
La leyenda tan sólo ha guardado
De un sepulcro el lugar ignorado
Y el severo perfil de un peñón.

Chorus

4. Por tres siglos tus hijos oyeron
El mandato imperioso del amo;
Por tres siglos tu inútil reclamo
En la atmosfera azul se perdió;
Pero un día gloria tu oído
Percibió, poderoso y distante,
Que allá lejos, por sobre el Atlante,
Indignado rugía un León.

Chorus

5. Era Francia, la libre, la heroica,
Que en su sueño de siglos dormida
Despertaba iracunda a la vida
Al reclamo viril de Dantón:
Era Francia, que enviaba a la muerte
La cabeza del Rey consagrado,
Y que alzaba soberbia a su lado,
El Altar de la Diosa razón.

Chorus

6. Tú también, ¡oh mi patria!, te alzaste
De tu sueño servil y profundo;
Tú también enseñastes al mundo
Destrozado el infame eslabón.
Y en tu suelo bendito, tras la alta
Cabellera de monte salvaje,
Como un ave de negro plumaje,
La colonia fugaz se perdió

Chorus

7. Por guardar ese emblema divino,
Marcharemos Oh Patria a la muerte,
Generosa será nuestra suerte,
Si morimos pensando en tu amor.
Defendiendo tu santa bandera
Y en tus pliegues gloriosos cubiertos,
Serán muchos, Oh Honduras tus muertos,
Pero todos caerán con honor.

CHORUS:
Your flag is a splendour of sky
Crossed with a band of snow;
And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,
Five pale blue stars.
In your emblem, which a rough sea
With its wild waves protects,
Behind the bare summit of a volcano,
A star brightly shines.

Chorus

1. Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping,
Lulled by the resonant song of your seas,
When, set in your golden valleys,
The bold navigator found you;
And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty,
And feeling your enchantment,
He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem
of your splendid mantle.

Chorus

2. From a country where the sun rises,
Beyond the blue Atlantic,
That man who had dreamt you
In search of you he launched to sea.
When you raised your pale forehead,
In the lively anxiousness of your hope,
Under the gentle dome of your sky
Already floated a strange banner.

Chorus

3. It was useless that your beloved Indian
Rushed into the fight with ire,
Because, covered with his blood, Lempira,
In the deep night he sank;
And of the heroic deed, in memory,
The legend alone has kept
A sepulcher in a forgotten place,
And the severe profile of a mountain peak.

Chorus

4. For three centuries your children heard
The imperious mandate of the master;
For three centuries your useless complaint
In the blue atmosphere was lost
But one glorious day your ear
Perceived, powerful and distant,
That there, far away, over the Atlantic,
Indignantly, a lion roared

Chorus

5. It was France, the free, the heroic,
Which in its dreams of centuries slept,
Awoke irate to life
At the virile protest of Danton:
It was France, who sent to the death
The head of the consecrated King,
And which built up proudly at its side,
The altar of the goddess of Reason.

Chorus

6. You also, oh my country!, arose
From your servile deep sleep;
You also showed the world
The infamous shackle destroyed.
And in your blessed soil, behind the tall
Hair of the wild jungle,
Like a bird of black feathers,
The fleeting colony was lost.

Chorus

7. To guard this sacred emblem
We shall march, oh fatherland, to our death;
Our death will be honoured
If we die thinking of your love.
Having defended your holy flag,
And shrouded in its glorious folds,
Many, Honduras, shall die for you,
But shall fall in honour.

Chorus

		<string>The Croatian flag has undergone numerous changes that followed the political events in the country. After the establishment of the socialist Croatia in 1949, Pan-Slavic tricolor (blue, white, red) was chosen as the official flag together with the Yugoslav guerrilla star in the middle. After gaining the independence in 1991, the star was replaced with coat of arms of the country and a crown was later added in order to distinguish the flag from the Ustasha flag. The flag and the coat of arms have great importance for Croatians. Checkered shield of the coat of arms represents the Croatian nation and five small crests represent Croatian provinces - Old Croatia from the left, Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria, and Slavonia.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The lyrics to the anthem were first printed in Danica (The Morning Star) magazine in 1835, under the title “Hrvatska domovina” (“Croatian Homeland”). The music was composed later (1840s) by Josip Runjanin, a Croatian Serb, on the basis of Donizetti’s “O sole piu ratto” from the opera “Lucia di Lammermoor”. Later, in 1861, the score went through some minor changes done by V. Lichtenegger. In 1891 the song was first sung as the unofficial national anthem at an exhibition held by the Croatian-Slavonian Economic Society in Zagreb. (Croatia, still being part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had that nation’s anthem as its official one.) It remained unofficial until February 29, 1972, when the first amendment to the Croatian Constitution declared it official (despite being part of Yugoslavia at the time) with a slight change in the lyrics upon 1990 independence.

		<string>The flag of Haiti, which has been adopted in 1958, is composed of two horizontal stripes of blue and red color. Between these stripes, national coat of arms is places. It consists of a white rectangle with the national emblem with palm tree, cannons and hat which was worn by freed slaves and thus is a symbol of freedom. The emblem also carries a white ribbon with inscription "L'Union Fait La Force", translated in "Unity is strength". Originally, the flag carried the colors of the French tricolor, but the white stripe was dropped during the uprising against the French rule in 1804. The rebellion was commanded by Toussaint L'Ouverture and Haiti became the first black independent territory. Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with Dominican Republic, and currently is due to the numerous natural disasters one of the poorest nations of the Western Hemisphere.</string>

		<string>The flag of Hungary consists of three horizontal stripes - red, white, and green. It appeared for the first time in its current form in 1848, when the uprising against the Austro-Hungarian domination took place. Its design should refer to the French tricolor, the traditional symbol of freedom. The origin of the flag, however, can be found in much earlier times. Red flag was already adopted as a standard of Commander Arpad in the 9th century. With the arrival of Christianity a cross on a white background was added. The green stripe has been on the flag since the 16th century. Since then, all the national colors as we know them today are present on the flag. Red indicates strength, white faith, and the oldest green stands for hope.</string>

		<string>Kölcsey’s poem, written in 1823, is set in the 17th century when Hungary was torn into three parts: the independent Hungarian principality in Transylvania, the Turkish occupied central Hungary and the remaining Austrian royal (Habsburg) areas in the north and the west. The subtitle of the poem is ‘A magyar nép zivataros századaiból’ meaning approximately ‘From the Stormy Centuries of the Hungarian People’.

The anthem was adopted in 1844, while Hungary was still a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  The title of the Hungarian anthem is often (incorrectly) given as the first line of the anthem,”Isten, áldd meg a magyart”, but the title of the poem (“Himnusz”) is the official title of the anthem.  While the poem has eight verses, it is almost always just the first verse that is performed, yet the entire poem remains the official anthem.

gilmore startAlso widely used in Hungary, but not an official national anthem, is the song “Szózat”, which can be described as the “national song” and is often sung in national celebrations.gilmore end  During the first years of Communist rule, it was debated by the legislators of the time to replace “Himnusz” with “Szózat, as Himnusz is a prayer and Hungary, under Communist rule, was officially atheist, but this was never done.

1. Isten, áldd meg a magyart
Jó kedvvel, bőséggel,
Nyújts feléje védő kart,
Ha küzd ellenséggel;
Bal sors akit régen tép,
Hozz rá víg esztendőt,
Megbűnhődte már e nép
A múltat s jövendőt!

2. Őseinket felhozád
Kárpát szent bércére,
Általad nyert szép hazát
Bendegúznak vére.
S merre zúgnak habjai
Tiszának, Dunának,
Árpád hős magzatjai
Felvirágozának.

3. Értünk Kunság mezein
Ért kalászt lengettél,
Tokaj szőlővesszein
Nektárt csepegtettél.
Zászlónk gyakran plántálád
Vad török sáncára,
S nyögte Mátyás bús hadát
Bécsnek büszke vára.

4. Hajh, de bűneink miatt
Gyúlt harag kebledben,
S elsújtád villámidat
Dörgő fellegedben,
Most rabló mongol nyilát
Zúgattad felettünk,
Majd töröktől rabigát
Vállainkra vettünk.

5. Hányszor zengett ajkain
Ozman vad népének
Vert hadunk csonthalmain
Győzedelmi ének!
Hányszor támadt tenfiad
Szép hazám, kebledre,
S lettél magzatod miatt
Magzatod hamvvedre!

6. Bújt az üldözött, s felé
Kard nyúlt barlangjában,
Szerte nézett s nem lelé
Honját e hazában,
Bércre hág és völgybe száll,
Bú s kétség mellette,
Vérözön lábainál,
S lángtenger fölette.

7. Vár állott, most kőhalom,
Kedv s öröm röpkedtek,
Halálhörgés, siralom
Zajlik már helyettek.
S ah, szabadság nem virul
A holtnak véréből,
Kínzó rabság könnye hull
Árvánk hő szeméből!

8. Szánd meg Isten a magyart
Kit vészek hányának,
Nyújts feléje védő kart
Tengerén kínjának.
Bal sors akit régen tép,
Hozz rá víg esztendőt,
Megbűnhődte már e nép
A múltat s jövendőt!

1. O Lord, bless the nation of Hungary
With your grace and bounty
Extend toward it your guarding arm
During strife with its enemies
Long torn by ill fate
Bring upon it a time of relief
This nation has suffered for all sins
Of the past and of the future!
 
2. You brought our ancestors up
Over the Carpathians’ holy peaks
By You was won a beautiful homeland
For Bendegúz’s sons
And wherever flow the rivers of
The Tisza and the Duna
Árpád our hero’s descendants
Will root and bloom.
 
3. For us on the plains of the Kuns
You ripened the wheat
In the grape fields of Tokaj
You dripped sweet nectar
Our flag you often planted
On the wild Turk’s earthworks
And under Mátyás’ grave army whimpered
Vienna’s “proud fort.”
 
4. Hajh, but for our sins
Anger gathered in Your bosom
And You struck with Your lightning
From Your thundering clouds
Now the plundering Mongols’ arrows
You swarmed over us
Then the Turks’ slave yoke
We took upon our shoulders.
 
5. How often came from the mouths
Of Osman’s barbarian nation
Over the corpses of our defeated army
A victory song!
How often did your own son agress
My homeland, upon your breast,
And you became because of your own sons
Your own sons’ funeral urn!
 
6. The fugitive hid, and towards him
The sword reached into his cave
Looking everywhere he could not find
His home in his homeland
Climbs the mountain, descends the valley
Sadness and despair his companions
Sea of blood beneath his feet
Ocean of flame above.
 
7. Castle stood, now a heap of stones
Happiness and joy fluttered,
Groans of death, weeping
Now sound in their place.
And Ah! Freedom does not bloom
From the blood of the dead,
Torturous slavery’s tears fall
From the cold eyes of the orphans!
 
8. Redeem, O Lord, the Hungarians
Who are tossed by waves of danger
Extend toward it your guarding arm
On the sea of its misery
Long torn by ill fate
Bring upon it a time of relief
They who have suffered for all sins
Of the past and of the future!

		<string>The flag of Indonesia, which is very similar to the flag of Monaco, has been adopted after gaining the independence in 1945. It consists of two horizontal stripes, where the top one is red and the bottom one is white. These colors may refer to the widely used cotton and red dye made from shells of shellfish. Another interpretation is talking about duality between heaven and earth, purity and justice, and courage and freedom. The flag appeared already around the 13th century, when a royal dynasty Majapahit ruled Indonesia. Later, it reappeared during the fights against the Dutch rule. Unofficially, the flag is called "Sang Saka Merah Putih" - "Noble red and white flag".</string>

		<string>The Irish tricolor is composed of green, white and orange vertical stripe. Green color refers to the color of the emerald island and its Catholic part, orange points to the Protestant community and it is also a color of the Orange-Nassau family. The white stripe represents the efforts to unify these religious groups and to live in peace. The flag appeared in 1848 when it was used by the organization "Young Ireland movement", which strived to oppose the British rule. It had become more popular after 1916 when Irish republicans declared independence and it was accepted as the national flag in 1920. Moreover, the flag refers by its design to the French tricolor, which is perceived as a symbol of independence and freedom.</string>

		<string>The text of Amhrán na bhFiann, consisting of three stanzas and a chorus, was written in 1907. It was first published in the newspaper, Irish Freedom in 1912. The chorus solely was quietly adopted as the National Anthem in 1926, amid much discussion about the national anthem. timothy green and karen c startThe anthem was originally written in English, the later Irish translation by Liam Ó Rinn is much more commonly sung in the country.tim and karen end  A section of the National Anthem (consisting of the first four bars followed by the last five) is also the Presidential Salute. 

There has been some criticism about the anthem due to its militant nature and anti-British tone. karen c startThe words “Fianna Fáil” (Warriors of Ireland) appear in Ó Rinn’s translation, later adopted as the name of an Irish political party, some advocate this be changedkaren c end to “laochra fáil” (heroes of Ireland) instead.  Also, some have argued that the melody is difficult to play, whereas others have pointed out that the whole song has been performed, instead of the chorus (which is the official anthem), or has been played at the wrong speed, both of which have happened at recent Olympic Games.

An anthem composed by Phillip Coulter called “Irelands Call” is used as a non-sectarian anthem, which is used by athletes from both Ireland and Northern Ireland when competing together as a unified team.

No more our ancient sire land
Shall shelter the despot or the slave.
Tonight we man the bearna bhaoil
In Erin’s cause, come woe or weal,
‘Mid cannons’ roar and rifles peal,

		<string>The Israeli flag is composed of two blue stripes along the top and bottom edges and blue six-pointed star in the center, placed on a white background. White and blue colors are intended to express purity of Zionist´s ideals and the sky. The star is associated with more than 700-year-old Jewish symbolism and is also known as the "Star of David". Moreover, the motif was found on the ring of King Solomon, that is why it is known as the "Seal of Solomon" as well. The blue stripes are inspired by the Jewish prayer shawl called "tallit". The design of the flag was formed in the late 19th century, when the Zionist movement attempted to create a Jewish state in Palestine. The flag was adopted in 1948 when the State of Israel was created.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The origins of “Hatikvah” far predate its use as the Israeli national anthem, in use since soon after its founding as the first Jewish state in modern history. The music is based on a folk song of unknown origin, but appears several times in European folk songs and religious music. The arrangement by Shmuel Cohen from 1888 is probably based on a Romanian folk song he heard during his childhood in Romania,  vexler startmost likely “Carul cu boi” (“The Ox Driven Cart”) vexler end. The melody also somewhat resembles  Smetana’s symphonic poem “Ma Vlast”, which in turn was based on a Swedish version of the Romanian song.  The melody is unique in that it is in a minor key, rare among national anthems; however the lyrics (that speak of a “hope”) are of a more uplifting nature.

The lyrics of the anthem were taken from the first verse and chorus from Naftali Herez Imber’s 1878 poem “Tikavatenu” (Our Hope), which had nine stanzas. At the first Zionist congress of 1897, it was adopted as the anthem of Zionism. The lyrics (primarily of the chorus) underwent a few changes between that time and the creation of the Jewish state of Israel some 50 years later, primarily a change where the song once spoke of a hope to return Zion, it now speaks of a hope to live as a free nation there.

There has been criticisms of the anthem both from Jews who feel the anthem is too secular, and from non-Jews who feel the anthem focusses too much on the Jewish population.

		<string>The flag of India consists of three horizontal stripes - saffron orange, white, and green. The symbolism of colors is as follows: orange represents Hinduism, courage and sacrifice, green faith and Islam, and white symbolizes commitment to peaceful coexistence of both religions. In the center of the white stripe, a motif of blue sun with torches - an ancient symbol of Brahmanism and god Vishnu, is placed. This motif has appeared in the 3rd century BC., but it has not appeared on the flag until 1947, when India gained independence from Britain, and when the former colony was divided into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. The symbol of wheel replaced Gandhi spinning wheel, which symbolized India's economic self-sufficiency.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>India’s various ethnic and cultural groups are honoured in the national anthem, and the melody is very reminiscent of Indian music as well. The music and words (including the English translation) were written by Rabindranath Tagore, the same composer of the music and words of the national anthem of Bangladesh.  The poem originally was written (in Bengali) in 1911 with five verses, only the first verse is the national anthem.

The subject of the song is the Universal Spirit that guides India (God), possibly as a unifying link to the varying ethnic groups of the nation. It was first used as a national anthem by the “Free State of India” (Axis-controlled India) from 1943-1945. It was officially adopted as India’s national anthem two days before the republic was declared in 1950. At the time of adoption, another “national song” “Vande Mataram” was popular with the people and many government leaders, but the fact that Vandemataram personified India as a Goddess was offensive to the monothestic Muslim population and led to Jana-gana-mana’s adoption as the national anthem.</string>

		<string>The Iraqi flag follows the design of the Egyptian flag with three horizontal stripes - red, white and black one. This is due to the fact that until 1963, union of these countries and Syria was planned. Initially, there were three green stars in the white stripe, which symbolized this future connection. In 1991, the inscription "Allahu Akbar" (Allah is great) has been added between the stars and the stars were omitted eventually. Pan-Arab tricolor has roots in the early 20th century, when Arab nations gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, and it expresses the unity of these nations. The symbolism of colors is as follows: red stands for bravery, white for generosity, black for victory, and green is the traditional color of Islam.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>After the ousting of the Saddam Hussein government, “Mawtini” was chosen as a new anthem for Iraq by the U.S. military administrator of the country after hearing it in a concert and admiring the song.  “Mawtini” was sung by the Palestinians in their uprisings against the British mandate and the Jewish immigration to British Palestine in 1936-1939 (the anthem is also an unofficial anthem of Palestine), and continues to be popular with Arabs today, especially as a show of support with Palestine. The author of the lyrics is the Palestinian poet Ibrahim Touqan.

“Mawtini” was meant as a temporary anthem, to be replaced later by an Iraqi government.  Now that an Iraqi government is set up, talks are underway to adopt a more permanent anthem for Iraq.

		<string>The flag of Iran is composed of three horizontal stripes of green, white, and red color. Traditionally, the green stands for Islam, white stripe, which is slightly wider, represents hope and peace, and the red stripe should provide courage in battles. These colors were adopted in 1907 already, but the central motif of the flag was until 1979, when Iran became the Islamic Republic, a lion with sword looking at the rising sun. Later, the lion was replaced by a red tulip motif, which is composed of five parts, each of which represents one pillar of Islam. The boundary between the green and white stripe and the red and white stripe is made of eleven inscriptions "God is great" in kufic script.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In 1990, due to the death of Ayatollah Khomeni, Iran adopted its current anthem after a competition that year.

		<key>flagInfo</key>
		<string>The flag of Iceland followed the example of the other Scandinavian countries and consists of a blue background bearing a red cross, which is embedded in the traditional white Scandinavian cross. The blue color is supposed to represent omnipresent Atlantic Ocean, the red lava and Icelandic volcanoes, and the white stands for another Icelandic natural landmarks - glaciers and geysers. The red cross also points to the historical ties with Denmark, that dominated Iceland since the 14th century. Iceland adopted the flag in 1918, when it won the statute of the autonomous territory of Denmark. However, the flag did not became official national flag until 1944, when Iceland became a fully independent.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Much like the United States anthem, the Icelandic national anthem was originally written for a particular occasion and it probably did not occur to either the poet or the composer that the song was destined to become a national anthem.

In Iceland, nation-wide celebrations were held throughout 1874 to mark the 1000th anniversary of the first Norse settlement of the island. (This is the “Iceland’s thousand years” that are referenced in the anthem.) To mark the occassion, the Bishop of Iceland decreed that church services on August 2 of that year were to be held based on the anniversary, and the text to be presented was Psalm 90. The Rev. Matthías Jochumsson then decided to write a poem based on the Biblical text and the millennial anniversary. While abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland, he met up with Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson, who Jochumsson asked to compose music for his poem.

While popular, it was not considered a national anthem. Icelandic independence was still over 40 years away. At the time that “Ó, Guð vors lands” (O, God of Our Land) was written, Icelanders usually sang “Eldgamla Ísafold” by Bjarni Thorarensen as a national anthem. However, that song had anti-Danish (the colonial power) lyrics and was set to the tune of the British national anthem. Therefore “Ó, Guð vors lands” (O, God of Our Land) was played as the national anthem when soverignity was proclaimed in 1918.   The anthem has three verses, but the first is usually the one sung.

1. Our country’s God! Our country’s God!
We worship Thy name in its wonder sublime.
The suns of the heavens are set in thy crown
By thy legions, the ages of time!
With Thee is each day as a thousand years,
Each thousand of years, but a day.
Eternity’s flow’r, with its homage of tears,
That reverently passes away.
Iceland’s thousand years!
Iceland’s thousand years!
Eternity’s flow’r, with its homage of tears,
That reverently passes away.

2. Our God, our God, we bow to Thee,
Our spirits most fervent we place in thy care.
Lord, God of our fathers from age unto age,
We are breathing our holiest prayer.
We pray and we thank Thee a thousand years
For safely protected we stand;
We pray and we bring Thee our homage of tears
Our destiny rest in Thy hand.
Iceland’s thousand years
Iceland’s thousand years
The hoarfrost of morning which tinted those years,
Thy sun rising high, shall command!

3. Our country’s God! Our country’s God!
Our life is a feeble and quivering reed;
We perish, deprived of Thy spirit and light
To redeem and uphold in our need.
Inspire us at morn with Thy courage and love,
And lead through the days of our strife!
At evening send peace from Thy heaven above,
And safeguard our nation through life.
Iceland’s thousand years!
Iceland’s thousand years!
O, prosper our people, diminish our tears
And guide, in Thy wisdom, through life!

		<key>flagInfo</key>
		<string>Italian national flag was inspired by the French flag, which was brought there in 1796 when Napoleon attacked Italy. It differs from the French flag only by the left stripe that has green color, not blue. There are several theories explaining the green color. One of them says that Napoleon chose green as a reminder of the green island Corsica, whereas others think it refers to the green uniforms of Milan militia. Green is also associated with the region of Lombardy. Italy was very fragmented and unstable until the late 19th century, and this was also reflected in the frequent changes of the design of the flag. The flag in its current form was adopted in 1946.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Different versions exist as to how of how Goffredo Mameli, a young poet, came to write the anthem in 1847. One reports that Mameli took the anthem to the musician Michele Novaro, a friend, who lived in Turin. Novaro composed the music, and Mameli returned to Genoa where he presented words and music to his friends. Shortly thereafter, “Fratelli D’Italia” (Brothers of Italy, another common name for the anthem) was played for the first time, at a popular assembly. The tune gained popularity throughout the peninsula, in defiance of the Austrian, Bourbon and Papal police.

The other and equally persuasive story goes that one evening in 1847, in the house of the American consul, the center of discussion was the uprisings of the day. Urged by many of the consul’s guests, Mameli improvised a few lines on the spot and later wrote the rest. A few days later a friend took the poem to Turin and read it aloud at a nobleman’s party. The composer Michele Novaro who was a guest at the same party, tried a few notes on the piano and then, went home to compose the song. The anthem was sung for the first time the next day by a group of political exiles in the Caffè della Lega Italiana of Turin.

“Il Canto degli Italiani” (the official title) was chosen on a provisional basis in October, 1946 as the national anthem to replace the royal anthem after becoming a republic, however, it was chosen on a provisional basis.  It wasn’t until nearly 60 years later, in 2005, that it was codified in law.

There are slight differences between Mameli’s original poem and how the anthem is sung today.  The song is usually sung with the first verse repeated twice then the chorus repeated twice.  (If subsequent verses are sung, they are only sung once, this is how the lyrics are presented below).  It is also customary to end with “Sì!” (Yes!), perhaps to match the last note of the song.

There is talk lately of replacing the anthem, firstly because the music is not up to the standards of Italian classical music tradition (ironically, some of Italy’s greatest composers have composed anthems in this tradition, which are used by Central and South American countries, giving birth to the term “Latin American epic anthem”), and also the lyrics refer to specific events that were familiar to the Italians of the time that the anthem was composed, but bear little to no resonance with today’s Italians. However, “Il Canto degli Italiani” is very recognizable in Italy and would be hard to replace.

Raccolgaci un’unica
Bandiera, una speme:

Già l’ora suonò.

I Vespri suonò. 

5. Son giunchi che piegano

Già l’Aquila d’Austria
Le penne ha perdute.
Il sangue d’Italia,
Il sangue Polacco,
Bevé, col cosacco,
Ma il cor le bruciò.

Union and love
Show the people
The way of the Lord.
Let us swear to free
Our native soil;
United under God,
Who can defeat us?

Chorus
 
4. From the Alps  to Sicily,
Legnano is everywhere;
Every man has the heart
and hand of Ferruccio
The children of Italy
Are all called Balilla;
Every trumpet blast
sounds the Vespers.
 
5. Mercenary swords,
they’re feeble reeds.
The Austrian eagle
Has already lost its plumes.
The blood of Italy
and the Polish blood
It drank, along with the Cossack,
But it burned its heart.

		<string>The flag of Jamaica was adopted in 1962, when the country gained independence. Jamaica, which was a British colony for centuries, had a role of center of trade with slaves. After the abolition of slavery in 1838, a violent coup took place and as a result, Jamaica is characterized by social problems and high criminality till nowadays. The flag was chosen in a public tender and it should reflect the turbulent Jamaican history. The version with horizontal stripes was rejected for being too similar to the flag of former Republic of Tanganika. Pan-African colors of black, green and yellow were thus situated to the form of Saint Andrew´s Cross and it should express a motto: "Hardships there are but the land is green and the sun shineth". Yellow color represents the sun, black stands for difficulties and green means the land.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Jamaica’s anthem was adopted upon independence in 1962. The music and lyrics were created separately and then arranged by Mapletoft Poulle and submitted to the National Anthem Committee where it was selected in a competition for a national anthem. (The first word of the second line is often sung as “Guide”, although “Guard” remains official.) 

As a constitutional monarchy with the British royal family as its head of state, the British royal anthem serves as the royal anthem of Jamaica as well.</string>

		<string>The flag of Jordan, which has been adopted in 1921, is composed of three horizontal stripes in black, white and green colors. On the pole side of the flag. there is a red wedge inside of which a white seven-pointed star is placed. The colors are in the typical pan-Arab spirit and it is taken from the flag of Hejaz since the first emir of Jordan was a son of king of Hejaz. Each stripe symbolizes one significant dynasty - black stripe represents Abass dynasty from Baghdad, the middle white stripe is a sign of the Umayyads from Damascus and green stripe refers to the dynasty of the Fatimids of Morocco. The red wedge represents dynasty Hashim from Jordan and the white star, which has been added in 1928, stands for Fatiha, the first sura of the Koran.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In use since independence in 1946, Jordan’s anthem, like Kuwait‘s, has a short version which is normally performed and a formal full version played on special occasions such as the King’s birthday.

		<string>Japan, or "Land of the rising sun", can feel proud of its flag, whose symbolism could be tracked back by several millennia. The red circle on a white background indicates a rising sun disc - so called Hinomaru in Japanese. The cult of sun enjoyed great attention there, Japanese emperors were said to be the descendants of a sun goddess Amaterasu. This symbol was drawn by samurais on ornamental fans called "gunsen" in the twelfth century already. In the 15th and 16th century, the symbol was used as a military insignia and it was displayed on military standards. When Japanese abandoned its policy of isolation in 1870 and began to make contact with other countries, they decided to use this ancient symbol as the central theme of its national flag.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>While in use since the early 1880s as a national anthem on a de facto basis, and the words to the anthem are from the tenth century or earlier, making “Kimigayo” the oldest national anthem in that sense, the government only officially adopted the anthem in 1999. The government presented its interpretation of the meaning of the anthem “Kimigayo” in the Diet during the deliberation of a bill to codify the country’s national flag and anthem. At the plenary session of the House of Representatives of the Diet held on June 29, 1999, Prime Minister Obuchi explained as follows: “Kimi in ‘Kimigayo’, under the current Constitution of Japan, indicates the Emperor, who is the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power; ‘Kimigayo’ as a whole depicts the state of being of our country, which has the Emperor – deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power – as the symbol of itself and of the unity of the people; and it is appropriate to interpret the words of the anthem as praying for the lasting prosperity and peace of our country.”

It is not known who first wrote the words of the anthem. They first appeared in the Kokinshu, a collection “of ancient and modern poems” dating from the tenth century. From very early times, the poem was recited to commemorate auspicious occasions and at banquets celebrating important events. The words were often put to music and were also used in fairy tales and other stories and even appeared in the Edo-period popular fiction known as ukiyo-zoshi and in collections of humorous kyoka (mad verse).

When the Meiji period began in 1868 and Japan made its start as a modern nation, there was not yet anything called a “national anthem.” In 1869 the British military band instructor John William Fenton, who was then working in Yokohama, learned that Japan lacked a national anthem and told the members of Japan’s military band about the British national anthem “God Save the King.” Fenton emphasized the necessity of a national anthem and proposed that he would compose the music if someone would provide the words. The band members requested Artillery Captain Oyama Iwao, who was well versed in Japanese and Chinese history and literature, to select appropriate words for such an anthem. Fenton put his own music to the “Kimigayo” words selected by Oyama, and the first “Kimigayo” anthem was the result. The melody was, however, completely different from the one known today. It was performed, with the accompaniment of brass instruments, during an army parade in 1870, but it was later considered to be lacking in solemnity, and it was agreed that a revision was needed. In 1876, Osamu Yusuke, the director of the Naval Band, submitted to the Navy Ministry a proposal for changing the music, and on the basis of his proposal it was decided that the new melody should reflect the style used in musical chants performed at the imperial court. In July 1880, four persons were named to a committee to revise the music. They were Naval Band director Nakamura Yusuke; Army Band director Yotsumoto Yoshitoyo; the court director of gagaku (Japanese court music) performances, Hayashi Hiromori; and a German instructor under contract with the navy, Franz Eckert. Finally a melody produced by Hiromori Hayashi was selected on the basis of the traditional scale used in gagaku. Eckert made a four-part vocal arrangement, and the new national anthem was first performed in the imperial palace on the Meiji Emperor’s birthday, November 3, 1880. This was the beginning of the “Kimigayo” national anthem we know today.

There has been some opposition lately to the “Kimigayo” both within Japan and in other east Asian countries, for its association with militarism, and for the virtual worship of the emperor in the lyrics.

		<string>The flag of Kenya was adopted in 1963 and it consists of black, red and green stripes, which are divided by two white stripes. The center is decorated with a shield of Masai warriors. The black color represents the African population, the red blood shed during the struggle for independence and green stands for Kenyan green vegetation and fertile soil. White stripes have unifying character and also stand for peace. Moreover, these colors are characteristic of the Kenyan African National Union, which has established itself during the struggle for independence over Britain. White stripes bordering both sides of the red stripe can also remind the opposition - the African Democratic Party of Kenya. Crossed spears of the Masai shield indicate readiness to defend national independence in the future.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Kenya’s was the first anthem in Africa to be written by a group commissioned by the government. One of the goals of the group was to incorporate traditional Kenyan music in the anthem, the resulting anthem, therefore, has a very African feel to it, a typical example of the “Eastern folk” style of anthem. The melody is actually based on a traditional Kenyan folk song, sung by mothers to their children.

Other criteria the group was charged with to create the anthem was that the tune had to be of the right length and quality, yet possesing the necessary dignity. It also had to lend itself to having words written for it, in both English and Swahili (the official languages of the country). The words had to unify the nation, yet contain the aspirations of the whole country. And the melody had to be able to be performed by a military band, without impairing the original feel of the song. With all those goals in mind, the anthem was ready in time for independence in December, 1963.

		<string>The flag of Kyrgyzstan is composed of a red leaf and a yellow symbol resembling the sun. The sun has 40 rays that represent 40 tribes living in the country. In the middle of the sun, there is a strange pattern that is supposed to remind a ceiling of a yurt - a traditional dwelling of the local steppe people. The red leaf probably originated from the red banner of Manase, national hero who united all the tribes into one state. Golden sun symbolizes peace and wealth, yurt stands for fraternity between nations and tribes in the country. The flag has not been adopted until 1992 - quite a long time after the collapse of the Soviet Union and a half year after proclaiming independence.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Instead of using the former anthem used as a Soviet republic as a national anthem for the new nation created in 1991 like many of its Central Asian neighbours (see Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan for examples), Kyrgyzstan adopted a brand new anthem in 1992, whose melody is slightly reminiscent of the native music to Central Asia, where this republic is located.</string>

		<string>The current flag of Cambodia was adopted in 1993 and consists of two blue stripes and one red stripe in-between. The red stripe bears a white silhouette of the temple Angkor Wat in its center. This symbol of Khmer dynasty from the 12th century is considered to be one of the biggest dominant of Cambodia. The towers of the temple should resemble Mount Meru, home of Hindu gods. The blue stripes stand for dignity, red stripe represents the nation, and white color refers to the power of religion. Until 1989, the flag with a yellow outline of the temple on a red sheet was used, but after the civil war and restoring the monarchy in 1993, King Sihanouk inclined to adoprion of the current flag.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem was originally adopted in 1941 and reconfirmed in 1947, around the time of independence from France. In 1970, the monarchy was abolished, thereby replacing the anthem as well. After the communist victory in 1975, former royalist symbols, including “Nokoreach”, were reinstated for a short while until replaced with their own national symbols. phuensaen on fb page per http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/khmer_rouge_flag.htmDuring exile, the second verse of Nokoreach was declared to be the anthem of Cambodiaphuensaen end; after the royalist forces defeated the Vietnamese puppet regime in 1993, putting an end to their long civil war, the royalist anthem (all verses) was also restored to Cambodia. The title of the anthem is derived from the name of an ancient Khmer kingdom.

		<string>The flag of Kiribati, which has been adopted in 1979, is composed of six ripples in blue and white colors, yellow sun and flying frigate. All this is placed on a red sheet. Ripples are meant to symbolize the Pacific Ocean, which washes the shores of Kiribati, and the frigate bird in flight indicates a domination over the ocean. The flag has been adopted the year when Kiribati attained independence from the Great Britain. Its appearance is based on the coat of arms, by which the islands were awarded in 1937 along with former Ellicei Islands, currently Tuvalu. Likewise Kiribati was at that time called differently - Gilbert Islands. Prior to 1979, the flag was represented by a blue British official flag and emblem of Gilbert Islands.</string>

The flag had three variants from 1978 to 2001, though all of them consisted of green leaf, white crescent and four white five-pointed stars in different variations. Today's version is enriched by four horizontal stripes in yellow, white, red and blue colors. Traditional symbols of Islam - a crescent and stars are now located in the green wedge on the left side of the flag. Each stripe as well as four stars represent four main islands of Comoros - Mohéli, Mayotte, Anjouan and Grande Comore. Mayotte has an official status of the French overseas territory, however, Comors Island do not recognize it.</string>

		<string>Having achieved independence in 1975, a different anthem was used until this anthem was adopted in 1978.  Both anthems mention the four islands in the Comoros, however, only three are internationally recognized as part of the Comoros, France still retains control over Mayotte (known as Maori (or Maoré) in the anthem).</string>

In addition, the black stripe is  framed by narrower yellow stripes and it also bears two white five-pointed star. The stars may indicate the two main islands, but according to the official interpretation it represents freedom and hope. The green color of the upper left field symbolizes the fertile soil of the islands and the red field serves as a reminder of the struggle for independence. The yellow color indicates the local bright sun and the black stripe represents the dark-skinned population. The islands were named in 1493 by Christopher Columbus during his voyage to India.</string>

		<string>In addition to its national anthem, adopted upon 1983 independence, St. Kitts and Nevis also has “God Save the Queen” as its royal anthem.

1. O Land of Beauty!
Our country where peace abounds,
Thy children stand free
On the strength of will and love.
With God in all our struggles,
Saint Kitts and Nevis be
A Nation bound together
With a common destiny.

2. As stalwarts we stand,
For justice and liberty,
With wisdom and truth
We will serve and honour thee.
No sword nor spear can conquer,
For God will sure defend.
His blessings shall for ever
To posterity extend.

		<string>A year before the establishment of North Korea in 1948, the government of the then Soviet-controlled sector of Korea adopted a new anthem (the one in use at that time was the anthem of South Korea with its former melody of the Scottish tune “Auld Lang Syne”). Unlike most North Korean patriotic songs, the anthem does not mention either the ruling party or the founder of the nation.  The title of the anthem is also the same as South Korea’s (as well as that of the predecessor to the Koreas, the Korean Empire), and the music is somewhat similar to the South Korean one as well.  There has also been a “united Korean anthem” created by blending the melodies of the anthems of North and South Korea seamlessly, used by some to promote Korean re-unification.

There also exists a patriotic song, “Song of General Kim Il Sung” which, while not the official national anthem of the country, is a very popular patriotic song and, unlike the national anthem, does reference the ruling family and founder of the country, and thus is used more in the country as part of the government’s mission to spread information about the founder of North Korea to its citizens.  As such, it is taught in schools and played at public gatherings more frequently than the national anthem is.

Three thousand leagues packed with natural wealth.
My beautiful fatherland.
The glory of a wise people
Brought up in a culture brilliant
With a history five millennia long.
Let us devote our bodies and minds
To supporting this Korea for ever.

Nest for the spirit of labour,
Embracing the atmosphere of Mount Paektu,
Will go forth to all the world.
The country established by the will of the people,
Breasting the raging waves with soaring strength.
Let us glorify for ever this Korea,
Limitlessly rich and strong.

		<string>First performed in 1896, it was well-known by all Koreans by 1910. (It was not the national anthem at this time however, as an imperial anthem was in use at the time.) At this time, the song was usually sung to a Scottish folk song, “Auld Lang Syne”, as well as occasionally to other music. In that year, the Japanese invaded Korea, and banned the song. However, it was still popular with Koreans abroad as a yearning for national independence.

In 1935 composer Ahn Eaktay wrote the music that’s currently in use for the anthem (he wanted the song to have a Korean melody and not that of a folk song of a foreign nation). It was adopted by the government in exile and then, when South Korea was founded in 1948, three years after the Japanese occupation ended, it was officially adopted by that government.

The anthem shares a title with that of the anthem of North Korea, as well as that of the Korean Empire, the music is also somewhat reminiscent of that of North Korea’s anthem.  There has also been a “united Korean anthem” created by blending the melodies of the two nations’ anthems seamlessly, used by some to promote Korean re-unification.</string>

		<string>The flag of Kuwait, which has been adopted in 1961, is composed of three stripes in the traditional pan-Arab colors - green, white, and black. In the left part of the flag, a black trapezoid is located. The official interpretation of the colors used is as follows: white represents our actions, green our meadows, black stands for our struggles and red signifies our future stained with blood of our enemies. Other interpretation based on the popular Arabic poem says that green represents fertility, white peace, red gallantry, and black battlefield or sand kicked up by the Kuwaiti riders while fighting for freedom. Formerly, Kuwait was a part of the Ottoman Empire, but after a revolt by the end of the First World War, Kuwait along with other states gained independence.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Rarely heard within Kuwait itself, Kuwait’s anthem, like Jordan‘s, has a formal full version of the anthem played on formal occasions, and a short version, which is simply the refrain of the full version.  The “national salute” of Kuwait is shorter still, which consists of the first 6 measures of the anthem.

		<string>The flag of Kazakhstan, which was adopted after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the proclamation of independence in 1992, consists of pale blue leaf with yellow ornament in the middle. The ornament is composed of silhouette of a steppe eagle (also known as "Berkut"), which carries on its wings a sun with thirty-two sun rays. Moreover, there is a yellow vertical stripe made of traditional national pattern. The azure blue color was characteristics to the original flag and it is a traditional color of the nomadic peoples of Central Asia. The very first national flag was adopted in 1937 and it bore two yellow inscriptions (in Kazakh and Russian). Later, during the Soviet rule, a blue stripe and a yellow hammer and sickle were added.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>On January 6, 2006, Kazakhstan replaced the anthem in use since its time as a Soviet republic (having changed the lyrics upon 1992 independence) with “My Kazakhstan”, a patriotic song written in 1958. The president Nursultan Nazarbayev revised the lyrics somewhat, thereby making him a co-author of the anthem.

		<string>The flag of the communist state Laos has rather unconventional design compared to the others communist flags. Instead of the typical star, there is a white circle located in the middle of a wide blue stripe. In addition, the blue bar is bordered by two narrower red stripes. White circle supposedly symbolizes the unity of the country or the moon shining over the Mekong River, which is represented by the blue stripe. The red color stands for a blood shed by Lao population during the fights for their freedom. The flag was created in 1945, when the independence of Laos was proclaimed. Officially, it has not been adopted until 1975. In the meantime, a red flag with three white elephants was used by the feudal kingdom.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The Laos anthem was composed in 1941 and was first used when the Kingdom of Laos was created in 1947.  Despite the original lyrics (sheet music with Lao lyrics (Lao and Latin scripts)) lacking references to the royal family, the lyrics were changed after the 1975 communist revolution that deposed the royal family; the melody, however, was retained.

		<string>The flag of Lebanon is composed of a broad white stripe in the middle and two narrower red ones at the top and at the bottom. The dominant feature of the flag is a silhouette of cedar placed in the center of the white stripe. Cedar has been Christian symbol of peace and prosperity even since as evidenced by an excerpt from the Book of Psalms of the Old Testament: "Justice blooms like a palm tree and matures like a cedar in Lebanon." The flag was adopted in 1943 after gaining the independence, and the colors red, white and green are expressing friendship towards other Arab nations. White also reminds the snowy mountain peaks and the red reminds bloodshed during the struggle for independence. Cedar is an important symbol till nowadays when the country is still recovering from civil war.</string>

		<string>Lebanon’s anthem was adopted on July 12, 1927, seven years after the French territory of Greater Lebanon was created.  When Lebanese independence was proclaimed in 1943, this anthem was adopted.

The composer of the anthem, Wadih Sabra, was trained in France and his music is a blend of Western and Eastern styles.</string>

1. All of us! For our Country, for our Flag and Glory!
Our valour and our writings are the envy of the ages.
Our mountains and our valleys, they bring forth stalwart men.
And to Perfection all our efforts we devote.
All of us! For our Country, for our Flag and Glory! 
All of us! For our Country

2. Our Elders and our children, they await our Country’s call,
And on the Day of Crisis they are as Lions of the Jungle.
The heart of our East is ever Lebanon,
May God preserve her until end of time.
All of us! For our Country, for our Flag and Glory!  
All of us! For our Country

3. The Gems of the East are her land and sea.
Throughout the world her good deeds flow from pole to pole.
And her name is her glory since time began.
Immortality’s Symbol–the Cedar–is her Pride.
All of us! For our Country, for our Flag and Glory!
All of us! For our Country

		<string>The flag of the island nation of St. Lucia is composed of a pale blue sheet where a black isosceles triangle whose legs are framed with white color is placed. This triangle shares its base with another yellow triangle whose legs are much shorter compared to the black triangle. Blue sheet, same as in the case of other island states, represents ocean that washes the shores of the island. Triangles should evoke so called Pitons - typical lava rocks located on the island. The flag was designed by artist Dunstan St. Omori and it has been adopted in 1979 when St. Lucia gained independence from the Great Britain.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>First adopted in 1967 when St. Lucia became self-governing, the national anthem was confirmed upon independence in 1979.  St. Lucia also retains the British anthem as its royal anthem, as they share a monarch.</string>

1. Sons and daughters of Saint Lucia 
Love the land that gave us birth. 
Land of beaches, hills and valleys, 
Fairest isle of all the earth. 
Wheresoever you may roam, 
Love, oh love, our island home. 

2. Gone the days when nations battled
For this Helen of the West. 
Gone the days when strife and discord, 
Dimmed her children’s toil and rest. 
Dawns at last a brighter day, 
Stretches out a glad new way. 

3. May the Good Lord bless our island; 
Guard her sons from woe and harm. 
May our people, live united, 
Strong in soul and strong in arm. 
Justice, truth and charity, 
Our ideals forever be.

		<string>The Principality of Liechtenstein was established in 1719 and it was declared a state in 1806. The flag consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, where the upper one is blue and the bottom one is red. In the left part of the blue bar, motif of a golden prince crown is located. The crown was added in 1937 in order not to be confused with the former flag of Haiti at Berlin´s Olympic Games. In the same year, a new interpretation of the flag was accepted. It says that the blue stripe symbolizes the sky, the red stripe represents the glow of fires during the evening gatherings, and the gold one stands for physical and mental unity of the nation, the state, and the royal house.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The Liechtenstein anthem, “Oben am jungen Rhein”, shares the same tune as the British “God Save the Queen”, despite there not being any ties to Great Britain in Liechtenstein’s history. This fact might be explained by its close ties to neighbouring Switzerland, who has also used the melody as its anthem in its past (as well as nearby Prussia, and later Germany, at the time). The fact that Liechtenstein shares a well-known tune with another nation has led to a few situations of amateur composers approaching Liechtenstein officials with proposals for a new anthem, convinced that one is needed.

The original lyrics were first written and adopted in 1850, and were changed in 1963; the second, third, and fourth verses were removed, and the remaining lyrics were slightly altered to remove references to Germany (written to denote Liechtenstein’s membership in the German confederacy (Holy Roman Empire)).

		<string>The "Lion Flag" of Sri Lanka was adopted in 1948, but it was used as a symbol of justice for a long time before. Its main motive is yellow lion on a red field holding a sword as a symbol of power. Green and red stripes were added to the left part of the flag after 1815 and these stripes are intended to symbolize Hindu Tamils and Muslim Maurs minorities living on the island beside the Sinhalese majority. Moreover, after renaming in 1972 from Ceylon to Sri Lanka, four yellow leaves were added to the lion´s field. Each leaf should remind one of the Buddhist values - kindness, compassion and desire to be a benefit for the society, joy, peace and well-balanced mind.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>After independence was granted to Sri Lanka (at the time known as Ceylon) in 1948, the need for a national anthem arose. As a result of a contest, Ananda Samarkone’s contribution, written in Sinhala, was chosen as the new anthem. It was first performed on the fourth anniversary of independence in early 1952.  There was some controversy with the early lyrics, and they were slightly changed in the early 1960s, against the author’s wishes.

The anthem is usually performed in Sinhala, but lyrics also exist in Tamil, the country’s other official language, and are usually performed in Tamil speaking areas of the country.  Despite a government official openly opining that the Tamil lyrics should be scrapped, a public backlash forced a reversal on this position, and the Tamil lyrics remain official.</string>

		<string>The flag of Liberia, which has been adopted in 1847, at first glance resembles the flag of the United States, and thus reflects its colonial past. However, Liberia was not a classic colony, it served since 1822 as a colony for freed slaves from the United States. Instead of the white star, the original flag displayed a Christian cross, which has later been replaced by a star in order to highlight an independence of Liberia. Eleven white or red stripes refer to eleven men who signed the Declaration of Independence of Liberia. The blue rectangle in the upper left part of the flag stands for the African continent and the star itself symbolizes the shining light of Liberia.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Founded by freed slaves from the United States in the 1820s, the words to the anthem of the second oldest independent African nation were written by the nation’s third president and adopted upon independence in 1847. Presumably, the anthem first had a different melody, as the current music was written in 1860.

		<string>The flag of Lesotho has been adopted in 2006 and it is composed of three horizontal stripes of green, white and blue colors. In the middle of the white stripe, a Basut black hat is located. The current flag has replaced the flag used by the military coup in 1987. It was composed of three fields in green, blue and white colors separated by diagonal lines. In the white box at the top left of the flag, Basut shield with a feathered spear was placed. The white color on the former flag represented peace, blue water and rain, and green prosperity. The current appearance of the flag, which has been adopted on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the independence of the country should to express tolerance and peaceful orientation of Lesotho.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Both the melody and the lyrics of this anthem come from European sources (in the case of the melody, not even composed to be the anthem of Lesotho). As such, there is debate in the country about the anthem, not only because the melody and lyrics were by foreigners, but also because the lyrics do not fit the melody perfectly. However, the anthem has been kept since it was first adopted.

The melody was from a Swiss songbook from around 1823. The composer was Ferdinand-Samuel Naegeli (later known as Ferdinand-Samuel Laur). The song that was later used as the Lesothan anthem was titled “Freiheit” (Freedom). Despite being from a Swiss songbook, the musical style is similar to that of anthems of other nations in the area in the “Eastern folk” style, perhaps indicating the melody was “Africanized” sometime after it was first introduced to the country.

The lyrics were by a French missionary to the area named François Coillard. Coillard grew up near the French-Swiss border, close to the area where Laur’s songbook was released, so Coillard may have known of the melody from there. The anthem first appeared in a Lesothan collection of songs for high schools in 1869.

The anthem originally had five verses, but by the 20th century, only the first and last verses were used, the middle verses, written to abolish traditional customs and religions, were deemed inappropriate. 

The anthem was adopted in 1967 by a royal decree, which was backdated to Independence Day, October 4, 1966.</string>

		<string>The Lithuanian flag consists of a tricolor of horizontal stripes in yellow, green and red colors. The flag was in force in the years from 1919 to 1940, until Lithuania did not became part of the Soviet Union and the flag was not dropped. After the collapse of the Sovier Union in 1989, the tricolor has been readopted as the national flag. Selected colors allegedly reflect Lithuanian values and local nature. Yellow represents the sun and fertile cornfields, green stands for forests and meadows and red refers to the bloodshed in the struggle for the country's independence and for the courage of Lithuanians during these fights. The flag that is used nowadays differs only by dimensions from the flag used before the Soviet occupation.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Poet Vincas Kudirka, also a Lithuanian patriot, wrote a 50-word poem on his views of the Lithuanian nation while it was still part of Czarist Russia.  Written in 1898, he also wrote the music after the poem was written shortly before his death the following year.

The song was first performed shortly before his death for a group of Lithuanians in St. Petersburg and was first performed in Lithuania itself in 1905 and was declared as the national anthem upon declaration of independence from Russia in 1918 and remained so until Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.

During the period of Soviet occupation, “Tautiška giesmė” was forbidden to be sung and a new anthem was written for the republic within the Soviet Union.  As early as 1988, when democratic reforms were being implemented in the USSR, “Tautiška giesmė” was being suggested as a replacement anthem for the Lithuanian SSR.  In 1990, Lithuania was the first Soviet Republic to declare independence from the USSR and “Tautiška giesmė” was again made the anthem of an independent Lithuania.</string>

		<string>The flag of Luxembourg is composed of a red-white-blue tricolor in a horizontal form. Luxembourg created a personal union with the Netherlands in the 19th century, as a result, their flags are very similar. However, the blue stripe of Luxembourg´s flag is lighter and the ratio of sides is different as well. Luxembourg was a long time under the Habsburgs rule and it did not achieved independence until 1867, although it was officially declared the Grand Duchy at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 already. The flag was adopted in 1972 and the colors of the tricolor were taken from the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy, which depicts a red two-tailed lion on a red and blue background.</string>

		<string>“Ons Heemecht” was written in 1859 and set to music in 1864. The first performance of the song was on June 5 of that year in Ettelbruck, where the Alzette and Sauer (two rivers mentioned in the opening of the song) meet. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1895, and proclaimed a “national emblem” on June 17, 1993. (The anthem was recently officially named “Ons Heemecht” over the old spelling “Ons Hémécht”.) The official lyrics are verses 1 and 4 of the original work.</string>

1. Where the Alzette flows through the meadows,
The Sura breaks through the crags.
Where the vine fragrant grows along the Moselle,
The sky promises us wine:
There lies the land for which we willingly
Dare everything down here.
Our homeland which we so deeply
Carry in our hearts.
Our homeland which we so deeply
Carry in our hearts.

2. O Thou above, Whose powerful hand
Leads the nations through the world,
Protect the Luxembourg land
From foreign yoke and threat.
As children Thou already instilled in us all
The spirit of freedom.
Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,
Shine for evermore.
Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,
Shine for evermore.

		<string>The flag of Latvia consists of three horizontal stripes - wider crimson stripes are located at the top and at the bottom and narrower white one is in-between. Allegedly, the flag dates back to the 13th century, when it served as a warrior´s flag, and therefore belongs to one of the oldest in the world. The flag in its current form was designed in 1917 and was officially adopted as the national flag in 1921. The flag was banned in times of Soviet domination, but people sometimes used it as an expression of disagreement with this condition. It has not been readopted until 1991, when Latvia became an independent state. The red color symbolizes the blood shed during the struggle for independence and the white stripe stands for justice, truth, and honor.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>“Dievs, svētī Latviju!” was originally written while Latvia was still a part of Russia. (This was the first song ever written to include the word “Latvia” in the lyrics). The composition of the song was a direct act of defiance against the Russians, who did not encourage national sentiments. Because of the Russians forbidding the use of the word “Latvia” in the song, it was replaced with the word “Baltics”.

The song was first performed publicly in 1873 at a singing festival, and first performed as a national anthem upon Latvian independence in 1918. It was officially confirmed as the anthem in 1920.

During the time that Latvia was part of the Soviet Union, the song was again forbidden, but upon leaving the U. S. S. R. in 1990, the anthem was again restored as the national anthem of Latvia.</string>

		<string>The flag of Libya has been altered many times in the last century. Until 2011, a purely green leaf was used since green is the color of Islam as well as of Libya. It also should have commemorated the Green Revolution of Muammar Gaddafi. Since the beginning of the civil war in 2011 a flag from the times of the Libyan Kingdom has been used as a symbol of the revolution. The current flag thus consists of three horizontal stripes, where the top one is red, the middle one is wider and black and the bottom one is green. In the middle of the black bar, a white crescent and a five-pointed star are placed. Each of the bars represents one Libyan region and the crescent with the star are traditional symbols of Islam.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Becoming an independent kingdom in late 1951, a competition was held the following year for a national anthem.  The winning entry, “Libya, Libya, Libya”, was first performed at the wedding of King Idris in 1955. The composer of the music also wrote the music for the anthems of Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.  The anthem was used until the monarchy was abolished in a coup by Moammar Qadaffi in 1969, when it was replaced with a new anthem.

During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the rebel forces against Qadafi’s government used the former anthem from the monarchy period as the Libyan national anthem in the areas that they control.  Upon the effective loss of power of the Qadaffi regime, “Libya, Libya, Libya” was restored as the national anthem, with the third verse that mentions the king not being used (it is still sometimes heard, or sometimes it is altered to mention other famous Libyan patriots).  (The fourth verse of the original is now the third verse).

		<string>The Moroccan flag consists of a red leaf where a green pentagram or "Seal of Solomon" is placed. This symbol was added on the flag in 1915 in order to distinguish it from the flags of other Arabic nations. Green and red are traditional colors of Islam, and the red color has been present on the Moroccan flag since the 16th century. Red is supposed to symbolize the blood kinship between the Prophet Muhammad and the king, but sometimes it is interpreted as a symbol of freedom of the nation. Until 1956, Morocco was a French colony, but unlike other colonized nations, Morocco did not adopt the French tricolor flag and managed to retain its own flag during this period.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The tune of “Hymne Chérifien” was already in use in Morocco when it was a French protectorate, along with a different set of lyrics. Upon independence in 1956, the anthem was confirmed, but the lyrics were not. A new set of lyrics was written in 1970. The “Sharif” of the title is a term given to one who is a protector of the tribe and all its assets.</string>

With title sublime,
Filling each heart,
Sung by each tongue,
Your champion has risen
And answered your call.
For your soul and your body,
The victory they have conquered.
In my mouth and in my blood
Your breezes have stirred both light and fire.
Up! my brethren,
Strive for the highest.
We call to the world

We salute as our emblem
God, Homeland, and King.

		<string>The flag of Monaco consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width - the top one is red and the bottom one is white. These colors are taken from the emblem of Genoese family of Grimaldi, which dates back to the 14th century. After the French Revolution, the Principality of Monaco was annexed to France, later it became a part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Finally, in 1861 it joined France again, but as an independent state this time. The flag was adopted on 4th April 1881 and is it very similar to the flag of Indonesia, whose proportions are only slightly different. Monaco even protested (unsuccessfully) in 1945 against the adoption of the Indonesian flag for its excessive similarity to the flag of Monaco.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Monaco’s first anthem dates from 1841. The first set of lyrics were used as a marching song for the Guarde Nationale, in which the author, Theophile Bellandro, was a captain. The music by Charles Albrecht along with the lyrics were officially adopted in 1867. In 1931 new lyrics were written in Monegasque, the native language of Monaco. The official lyrics are just one verse, and are not often sung, except at official occassions (the instrumental versions are heard more often). Also, despite French being more prevalently spoken in the principality, and French words exist for the anthem (under the title “Hymne Monégasque”), only the Monegasque lyrics are official.

		<string>The flag of Moldova consists of a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow and red stripes. This base is identical to the flag of Romania, however, in the middle of the yellow stripe, a Moldovan national emblem is placed. It depicts a golden eagle holding a golden cross in its beak, an olive branch in one talon and a scepter in the other. The eagle holds a shield where a bison's head is displayed - it should denote strength, independence and pride of the Moldovan nation. Until 2010, the national emblem was used on the face side of the flag only, so the flag of Moldova belonged to the few flags with different sides. At the present time, there is a mirror version of national emblem on the reverse side.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>This neighbour of Romania, with which also shares a language (called “Romanian” in Romania and “Moldovan” in Moldova), and once proposed to reintegrate with that nation, also used the Romanian anthem for the first few years after its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union (which was also its anthem during its short time of independence from 1917-1918). Its new anthem was adopted in 1994. Originally a 12 verse poem, only stanzas 1, 2, 5, 9, and 12 make up the present-day anthem.</string>

Hiding starlight bright and shining.

		<string>The flag of Montenegro is composed of a red leaf framed by a gold trimming which has a width of 1/20 height of the flag. The aspect ratio of 1: 3 forms unusually elongated shape of the flag. In the center of the flag, a national emblem is placed. It depicts a golden double-headed eagle holding a golden scepter in the right claw and a blue-green orb with a golden cross in the left claw. The eagle bears a blue shield with a gold lion on a green lawn on his chest and a crown is erected above his head. The flag resembles an emblem of a family Petrovic and it was officially adopted in 2006, when the Montenegrin population decided in referendum to split up from Serbia and to create an independent state.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Montenegro adopted new national symbols on July 12, 2004 (while still in federation with Serbia). The new anthem “Oj svijetla majska zoro” has a long history as a folk song in Montenegro.

The lyrics to the right are presented as normally sung, the official lyrics do not repeat lines.

O the bright dawn of May
Montenegro our mother 
Montenegro our mother 

We are sons of your rocks
We are sons of your rocks
and keepers of your honesty

We love you, the rocky hills
and their eerie gorges deep
that had never to endure
the shameful chains of slavery.

Montenegro our mother

O the bright dawn of May
Montenegro our mother 
Montenegro our mother 

While our unity gives wings
to our Lovcen cause
it shall brought the pride and glory
to our beloved homeland.

The river of our waves,
that enter the two seas,
shall to ocean guide the voice
Montenegro is eternal.

shall to ocean guide the voice
Montenegro is eternal.

Montenegro is eternal.

		<string>The flag of Madagascar has been inspired by a flag of the tribe Hovo and it consists of three stripes in total. The first stripe is vertical and it is located in the pole part of the flag. The waving part of the flag is filled with two horizontal stripes - red on the top and green at the bottom. Originally, a red-white flag of dynasty Merino symbolized efforts to keep independence during the times when Europeans were colonizing Africa. White color traditionally stands for purity and chastity, red for independence and green signifies hope for better tomorrows. According to another interpretation, green represents the coastal population, white is associated with the family of Volafots and red with the family of Volamens from the 17th century.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The music of the national anthem was composed by Norbert Raharisoa, a music teacher and professor. The words were written by Pasteur Rahajason, a priest. It was first performed in the public when Madagascar was declared an autonomous republic within the Union Française. The parliament officially adopted the anthem on April 27,1959. Therefore Madagascar already had a national anthem when it achieved full independence on 26th June 1960.

		<string>Marshall Islands are located in the northern part of the Pacific Ocean and the base of their flag is a dark blue sheet. From the lower left corner of the sheet, rays of white and orange color are gradually expanding towards the upper right corner. On the left side of the flag, a white star with four long and twenty shorter rays are placed. Twenty-four rays represent the same number of administrative districts of islands and the long beams are referring to the Christian tradition in the islands and four local largest cities. The orange color of the upper bar indicates the wealth of islands, while white represents hope. Dark blue background evokes the Pacific Ocean that surrounds the islands.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In 1986, the Marshall Islands were granted full sovereignty from the trust territory arrangement, and the current anthem was adopted in 1991.  The words and music were written by the first president of the Marshall Islands.</string>

		<string>The flag of the Republic of Macedonia was selected on the basis of a public competition in 1995. The flag consists of motif of a yellow sun with six axially symmetrical rays expanding towards the edges of the flag placed on a red background. Originally, the flag with motif of a vergin sun was selected and it was used between the years 1992 and 1995, but it was eventually abandoned since the Greeks opposed. They regarded this symbol purely Hellenic. moreover, it already was a symbol of Greek province of Macedonia. Opinions on this matter differ - some argue that the symbol occurred much earlier in the Persian and other ancient empires, but the Greeks still won this dispute, and Macedonians eventually turned to the current flag.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The national anthem of the Republic of Macedonia was created in 1943 by Vlado Maleski, a poet from Struga. It was adopted as the anthem of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia while in Yugoslavia after World War II. The song was later selected to be the anthem of the newly independent Republic of Macedonia after its independence in 1991.</string>

		<string>The flag of Mali, which has been adopted in 1961, is composed of a vertical tricolor consisting of green, yellow and red stripes. These colors have a classical pan-African symbolism - green indicates the forests and the land's fertility, yellow represents the sharp local sun and red recalls the blood shed during the struggles for freedom. Mali originally formed a federation with Sudan and they shared one flag, which was compared to its present form enriched by a figure of a black man called "Kanaga" placed in the middle of the yellow stripe. Senegal, however, left the federation and replaced the figure by a star. Neither Mali did stick to this form of the flag and the "Kanaga" was removed from both flags. The reason was that the majority of the population are Muslims and it is unacceptable for them to portray the human figure on the flag.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The music of Mali’s anthem, adopted two years after independence, is based on an old folk tune, possibly dating from the Mali Empire of the 13th century.  The anthem is in the European march style of anthem, fitting as it is a former French colony, France being the originator and most famous example of that anthem style.  Despite the title commonly being given as the first line of either the chorus or the first verse, the anthem’s official title is “Le Mali”.</string>

		<string>The current flag of Myanmar has been adopted along with a new constitution in 2010 and it is composed of three horizontal stripes in red, green and yellow colors. In the middle of the flag, a large white five-pointed star is placed. The flag has been inspired by the flag of Burma from the period around the World War II. The yellow stripe refers to solidarity between people, green stands for natural wealth of the country, and the red stripe reminds courage of the local population during numerous fights.  The white star symbolizes hope in the unity of all people living in the country. The flag, however, is not viewed positively by everybody, the opposition of the current government,  for instance, considers it to be a symbol of attempts to forced assimilation of local ethnic groups.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In 1930, Saya Tin was a member of the “Dobama Asiayone” (“We Burmans”) group that was a Burmese nationalist group against the controlling British government.  He composed the song “Kaba Ma Kyei” as the party song and first performed it on July 20, 1930.  Tin was promptly arrested for inciting rebellion and was jailed until 1946.  Meanwhile, the song became a national symbol during British rule and then the Japanese occupation.

In 1947, before independence, a committee was formed to select proposals for the future flag, coat of arms and national anthem. Saya Tin became a member of this committee in July 1947. It was decided to adopt Tin’s composition with some slight changes of the text. On 22nd September 1947, another correction of the text was done and this version became official upon independence in 1948. (A slight change was also made to the words, presumably in 1988, when the name of the country was changed to Myanmar).

Two versions of the anthem exist, a short one when played internationally, and a longer one that adds a more Burmese type of music to the beginning of the piece that is performed domestically.  There is also an interesting custom associated with the national anthem, and that is that singers who sing the anthem must give a small bow upon the conclusion of their singing, as a sign of respect for the anthem and the nation.

		<string>The flag of Mongolia, which has been adopted in 1992, is composed of three vertical stripes, where the middle one is blue and the other two are red. In the left red stripe, a yellow ideogram called sojombo, which is connected with ancient symbolism resulting from Buddhist traditions, is placed. The upper part of the symbol is made up of three flames, which should refer to the past, present and the future. The moon and sun symbols represent the idea of the world and eternity. Another symbol included in sojombo is yin and yang - a traditional Buddhist symbol of harmony of the opposites, which is portrayed by two endlessly outrunning fish. The two rectangles on the sides of sojombo represent a wall, which according to the Mongolian saying represents a friendship that is stronger than any stone wall.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Mongolia’s current anthem has been in place since 1950, yet has undergone several changes in its lyrics. The original lyrics were replaced in 1961, perhaps partly due to the mention of Stalin in the original lyrics, as the Communist world underwent a process of “de-Stalinization” after his death in 1953; it has been reported that between the time of his death and the replacement of the lyrics in 1961, the second verse was not performed.

After the transition to democracy from Communism in 1990, the original lyrics from 1950-1961 were restored, but with slight changes, removing the references of Communist heroes. In July, 2006, the lyrics were slightly revised again, and both verses now have their own unique refrain.</string>

		<string>The flag of Mauritania consists of a green leaf with a yellow crescent bearing a yellow five-pointed star. The flag has both traditional African and Islamic symbolism - yellow and green are the traditional Arabic colors and green together with the crescent moon and the star are of importance for the Muslim majority in Mauritania. The country was dominated by the Berber nomads from the 11th century, thus became a center of Muslim faith, which was spread throughout North Africa from here. In the 16th century, Berbers were defeated by the Arabs, who ruled Mauritania until the 20th century, when the French overtook the control. The current flag has been adopted in 1959, when the country gained independence from France.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>One of the more unique anthems of the world, Mauritania’s anthem is based on a late eighteenth-century poem by Baba Ould Cheikh, who was inspired to write due to the problem of the myriad of Arabian sects that were developing at the time.

The first president of the country, shortly before independence from France, asked the director of the orchestra of the French broadcasting service, Tolia Nikiprovetzki, to select a melody to be used for the future anthem. This melody, known for many centuries and was the melody that originally belonged to the verses, was selected from the many selections of folk music that were considered.

The peculiar rhythym of the anthem (known as “fatchou”) makes it very difficult to sing, thus the anthem is often (but erroneously) listed as wordless.

Be a helper for God, and censure what is forbidden,
And turn with the law which, which He wants you to follow,
Hold no one to be useful or harmful, except for Him,
And walk the path of the chosen one, and die while you are on it!
For what was sufficient for the first of us, is sufficient for the last one, too.
And leave those people who do evil things with respect to God.
They misrepresented him by making him similar, and made all kinds of excuses.
They made bold claims, and blackened notebooks.
They let the nomads and the sedentary people, both make bitter experiences,
And the great sins of their [doctrinal] innovations bequeathed small.
And just in case a disputant, calls you to dispute about their claims,
Do not, then, dispute on them, except by way of an external dispute.

		<string>The flag of Malta consists of two vertical stripes of white and red color, and a cross of St. George lined with red at the top of the left side of the flag. Cross with an inscription "FOR GALLANTRY" was given to Malta by the British as an honor for resilience during the bombing by a German-Italian troops during the World War II. The flag was officially adopted after gaining the independence in 1964, and its design is probably derived from the flag of the Norman Hauteville House, which conquered Malta in the late 11th century. Allegedly, Count Roger of Hauteville gave snipping of their flag to Maltese when leaving to Normandy. Progressively, the flag overtook the role of national flag.</string>

		<string>First performed February 3, 1923, “L-Innu Malti” became the national anthem in 1945. The author of the anthem’s lyrics, Dun Karm Psaila, (Malta’s national poet), was originally comissioned to write a school hymn to already-existing music, written the year before. He thought of the idea of a national anthem in the form of a prayer, to bind together the political parties and the country with the commonality of prayer.

		<string>Mauritius is an island located in the eastern direction of Madagascar and its flag consists of four horizontal stripes. The top one is red, then blue, yellow and green at the bottom. The colors used are of traditional Pan-African importance. Red color indicates the struggles to achieve independence and blue color represents the Indian Ocean, which surrounds the island. Yellow stripe should symbolize bright future of the island after gaining independence and green stripe reminds lush vegetation of Mauritius. These colors have been inspired by coat of arms of the island, which King Edward VII gave to Mauritius in 1906. The flag has been adopted in 1968 when the island gained independence from the British rule.</string>

		<string>The flag of the Maldives, which has been used in its current form since 1965, is composed of a red leaf, where a smaller green rectangle is placed. In the middle of the green field, a symbol of a white crescent is located. Green is the traditional color of Islam, and it also indicates progress and peace. The red color reminds the bloodshed during the struggles for freedom and the crescent is another traditional symbol of Islam. The flag that was used in times of autonomous sultanate bore a white stripe with diagonal black stripes compared to the todays version. The previous flag that was still used in the early 20th century was composed only of a red leaf, which was common to many Arab island territories.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Until the late 1940s the state anthem of the Maldives was a melody with no lyrics. It was called the Salaamathi and was performed by the royal band on state occasions at the Etherekoilu, the official residence of the King. 

In 1948 it was determined that the Salaamathi needed replacement with lyrics to accompany a new melody. The words were composed by a young poet and later a chief justice, Mohamed Jameel Didi.

Jameel Didi looked around for a tune to accompany his poem. His uncle, the chief justice Hussain Salahuddine, had just acquired a new clock that played a tune at the stroke of midday, the Scottish folk song “Auld Lang Syne”, and Jameel decided to use that tune for his poem (slightly modified to fit the words).

Although the Salaamathi survived as the royal anthem until 1964, it did not occur to anyone to adopt it as the national anthem. In 1972, for the first time in history, the Maldives hosted a foreign head of state – Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. The Maldive government of the time deemed it necessary to compose a different tune for the anthem instead. Hastily they commissioned the composition of a new melody. The new melody of the Maldive national anthem was composed by a distinguished Sri Lankan maestro, Pandit Wannakuwattawaduge Don Amaradeva. The original lyrics were used, with some changes to mark the fact that Maldives has been a republic since 1968.

Although as many as seven verses can be found for this anthem, it seems that the most common representation is the first two verses, which is what is presented here.

		<string>The current form of the flag of Malawi was approved in 1964. The flag consists of three horizontal stripes - black, yellow and green. In the black bar, a symbol of rising sun with 31 rays is located. The black color is supposed to symbolize the people of the country, the red stands for bloodshed in the struggle for independence of African states and the green represents vegetation of Malawi. The theme of the rising sun reminds hope after achieving independence, but also the meaning of word Malawi - an effect which occurs over the Lake Nyasa at sunset. The flag was inspired by the flag of the Malawi Congress Party.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Selected as a result of a competition a few months before independence in 1964, the anthem resembles the musical style of southern African songs, like others in the “Eastern folk” style of anthem.

		<string>The Mexican tricolor consists of green, white and red vertical stripe. In the middle of the white stripe, there is a national emblem depicting an eagle clutching a snake in its talons and beak. Under this scene, an oak and laurel branches tied with a ribbon in the colors of the tricolor are portrayed. According to Aztec legend, the Indian people were instructed by god Huitzilopochtli to settle down in place where they would see this scene. It happened on an island in lake Texcoco, where they settled and founded the city of Tenochtitlan (in the area of today's capital). The symbolism of colors is as follows: green stands for independence, white for chastity and purity of religion, and red refers to blood union of local ethnic groups - the blood of Spanish, Indian and bi-racial.</string>

		<string>After independence from Spain in the early nineteenth century, there were many songs popular with the public that were an attempt to be a national anthem, but none succeeded. Finally, in 1853, President Santa Ana announced a nation-wide contest for the lyrics for a new national anthem. One of the entrants, an accomplished poet named Francicso González Bocanegra, was originally not interested in entering. However, his fiancée was confident in his skills and, under false pretenses, lured him into a room of her parent’s house and locked him inside, refusing to let him out until he wrote an entry for the contest. After four hours, using the pictures in the room of the epics of Mexican history as his inspiration, Bocanegra finally won his freedom by slipping a ten verse poem under the door. His fiancée and her father approved of the submission, and so did the judging committee, his entry won unanimously.

After the contest for the lyrics came the contest for the melody. This contest was won by Jaime Nunó Roca, duran starta Spaniard from the small Catalan Pyrennes town of Sant Joan de les Abadessesduran end, who was conductor of the National Band  He titled his entry “Dios y Libertad” (God and Freedom). The combination of Nunó’s music with González’s lyrics was first presented to the nation at the Independence Day celebrations on September 16, 1854. Shortly after his work was adopted as the national anthem, Nunó Roca left Mexico to spend the rest of his life in Buffalo, New York, United States, and sold the anthem to a music house in that country. When he visited Mexico in 1901, he was given a state reception, a medal, and money. He passed away in 1908, but in 1942, shortly before the national anthem was officially adopted, his remains were flown to Mexico and given a state funeral in the Hall of Heroes, where Francicso González Bocanegra was also buried.

In 1943, the anthem was officially adopted, and at that time it was decreed that the first, fifth, sixth, and tenth verses would comprise the anthem.  When a shorter version of the anthem is required, it is somtimes performed with the chorus, then the first verse, followed by the chorus, followed by the tenth verse, followed by the chorus; a shorter version still just has the chorus, first verse, and the chorus.

In the waves of blood.
 
War, war! In the mountains and the valley,
The dreadful cannons thunder,
And the deafening echoes resound
The cries of Union! Liberty!
 
Chorus
  
6. O Homeland, before your unarmed sons
Bend their necks under the yoke,
Your countrysides will be watered with blood
And in blood will be their footprints.
 
And your temples, palaces, and towers
Will fall with terrible thunder,
And their ruins shall live to say,
“This was the fatherland of a thousand heroes.”
 
Chorus
  
10. Homeland, Homeland! Your sons swear
To breathe out their breath on your altars,
If the clarion with its warlike tone
Calls them to struggle with valour.
 
For you the garlands of olive!
For them a memory of glory!
For you a laurel of victory!
For them a tomb of honour!
 
Chorus

		<string>The flag of Malaysia is very similar to the flag of the United States. Fourteen stripes of white and red color indicate 13 countries of the federation and a territory of the capital. The official name of the flag from 1997 could be translated as "Famous stripes". The yellow star has also fourteen points and it is placed on a blue field in the upper left part of the flag together with a yellow crescent. Crescent and star are traditional symbols of Islam, blue refers to the membership of the British Commonwealth and the red and white are considered traditional colors of Southeast Asian Malagasy nations. Yellow is the color of sultans who rule the nine states of the Malaysian federation.</string>

		<string>In 1888 the Sultan of Perak was invited by Queen Victoria as a guest. When the Sultan’s aide was asked what the anthem of Perak was, so that it could be played upon his formal arrival, the aide, not wanting to be embarrassed by saying that Perak did not have an anthem, perhaps giving the impression that his country was “backwards”, proceeded to hum a favourite tune of his from the Seychelles, which is believed to have been composed by Pierre Jean Beranger. It was, therefore, from that moment on, the tune for the state anthem of Perak.

After an Indonesian opera performed it in Singapore (at the time, part of Malaysia), the tune became popular throughout all of Malaysia in the 1920s and 1930s as the love song “Terang Bulan” (Moonlight). (“Terang Bulan” is now forbidden to be performed in Malaysia.)

Before independence was scheduled for Malaysia in 1957, each of the (then) eleven states of Malaysia had their own anthem (which they have retained to this day), but there was no unifying anthem for the whole country. When independence was approaching, Tunku Abdul Rahman, then the Chief Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (later Malaysia’s first prime minister), led a committee to select a new anthem. Hundreds were recieved, but none were deemed suitable. Finally, the anthem for the Malaysian state of Perak was considered, and the melody, due to its “traditional flavour” was selected to be the melody for the new anthem.

Once the melody was selected, new lyrics had to be written for it. The panel of judges charged with selecting a new anthem wrote the lyrics, with Tunku Abdul Rahman leading the group.

In 1992, the anthem was rearranged to give it a livelier, march rhythym, which was unpopular with the citizens.  In 2003 the tempo was returned to what it was originally.

There exists a full version of the anthem, as well as a shorter version, both presented here.  The full version is generally used in the presence of the King of Malaysia, the shorter version is used to honour the Queen of Malaysia and lesser officials.

		<string>The flag of Mozambique has been adopted in 1983 and Mozambique is currently the only country whose flag bears a symbol of a weapon. The flag consists of three stripes in green, black and yellow colors, which are separated by narrower white stripes. On the left side there is a red wedge where symbols of yellow star, white book, hoe and Kalashnikov are layered. The flag has been inspired by the flag of the Liberation Front of Mozambique which was fighting for independence. The symbolism of colors is as follows: green represents fertile ground, black African population and yellow stands for mineral wealth. The hoe refers to the agricultural population, the book highlights the importance of education and the weapon commemorates the fights for freedom. White color traditionally symbolizes peace.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>On April 30, 2002, Mozambique adopted a new national anthem to reflect their new multi-party political system.</string>

		<string>The current flag of Gabon has been adopted in 1960 when the country declared independence from France. It is composed of three horizontal stripes from the top in green, yellow and blue colors. The flag should signal solidarity with the other independent African states since the first two bands were taken from the flag of Ethiopia. Moreover, it refers to the former ties to France as Gabon´s colonizer (via the blue bar). Green stripe symbolizes the Gabonese forest and timber industry, yellow stripe stands for the local sharp sun and the zero parallel, which passes through the country. Blue bar represents the Atlantic Ocean, which washes the western shores of the country, as well as all waters of the country - especially the river Ogooué.</string>

		<string>The flag of African country Niger, which has been adopted a year before gaining its independence in 1959, consists of three horizontal stripes in orange, white and green colors. Moreover, in the middle of the white stripe, an orange circle is placed. The symbolism of colors used is as follows: red represents the Sahara Desert in the north, white stands for purity, green for hope or Nigerian vegetation in the southern parts of the country. Orange circle is to commemorate the bright sun illuminating the local rivers and landscape. The three stripes also represent three main regions of the country. The color variation may remind the flag of Ivory Coast, which was as well as Niger colonized by French.</string>

		<string>The Nigerian flag was adopted after gaining independence from Britain in 1960. The flag was chosen in 1959 from more than 200 drafts and the winning "designer" was a student from the city Ibadan Michael Taiwo. Originally, the flag consisted of three vertical stripes - two green on sides and one white in-between. Moreover, there was a red sun in the middle of the white stripe, but it was omitted later on, so only three stripes remained till nowadays. The flag should evoke the river Niger undulating between the greenery of Nigerian fields and forests. Another interpretation says that Green refers to the agricultural tradition of Nigeria and that white stripe represents peace.</string>

		<string>The flag of Nicaragua, which has been used since 1908, is composed of three horizontal stripes in blue, white and blue colors. In the middle of the white stripe, there is a national coat of arms in the shape of a triangle. The emblem displays five volcanoes that are supposed to represent five states of former United Provinces of Central America - along with Nicaragua it was Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and El Salvador. A rainbow extends over the volcanoes together with Phrygian cap of liberty and white torches. Two blue stripes are to remind the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, but also justice and loyalty. White traditionally symbolizes purity and honesty. Similar symbolism can be found on the flags of El Salvador and Costa Rica.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The melody of the anthem goes back to the 1700s as a liturgical anthem in Spain. It was brought to Nicaragua shortly before independence in 1821, and was declared as the country’s first official anthem sometime between 1835 and 1837.  The wordless melody was used until 1876, when it was replaced with the song “Soldados, ciudadanos” (Soldiers, Citizens).  (This anthem may have been wordless until 1889). It was replaced yet again in 1893 after General José Santos Zelaya took over the country; the anthem “Hermosa Soberana” (Beautiful Sovereign) was composed by Zelaya’s son-in-law Alejandro Cousin and was written by either Rubén Darío, Santiago Argüello or Manuel Maldonado.  Despite being replaced in 1910 after Zelaya fled the country, the song remains a popular patriotic song in Nicaragua.

After decades of political upheaval, which was reflected in the anthem, it was decided to bring stability back to the country by bringing stability to the anthem, so the first anthem, the piece of liturgical music brought over from Spain nearly 90 years previously, was reinstated as the anthem, but had to be recreated from memory as no written record of the music was found.  Also, emergency lyrics were written by Marco Antonio Ortega under the title “La Patria Amada” (The Beloved Homeland) until a contest could be held for new lyrics.

The first priority was to arrange the old music of the national anthem, and Luis Abraham Delgadillo, a Nicaraguan composer who studied in Milan, was chosen to arrange the anthem.  In 1918, the key of the anthem was changed to G major and it was made to be played by a band more easily; the new arrangement made the anthem also sound more like other “Latin American epic anthems” also in use by neighbouring countries.  A contest was then held for the new lyrics for the anthem.  The requirements were that there be words for both parts of the anthem, the only topic would be peace and work (as a contrast to the political upheavals of recent history) and that the words fit the melody.  The winning lyrics were  adopted by the government in 1939.</string>

		<string>The Dutch flag is composed of a red-white-blue tricolor and it is also known as "The Prince's Flag". Records about the prince William of Orange´s flag appeared already in 1572, when William led the resistance against the Spanish domination, however the flag was originally orange, white and blue. Later, the orange stripe was replaced by a red one so that it was better visible on the seas. Dutch tricolor is the oldest national tricolor flag, and it served as an inspiration for the French and Russian tricolor. As the Russian flag later influenced many Slavic flags, the Dutch tricolor indirectly affected these flags as well. The Dutch flag is considered to be one of the oldest flags which retained its design even over times of various coups.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The Dutch national anthem is one of the oldest anthems in existence, the melody was known from before 1572 as a French Huguenot melody titled “Charles”, and the song first appeared in 1626 in a collection of songs assembled by Adriaan Valerius. Philips van Marnix van Sint Aldegonde is widely credited as the author, but as this is very much in dispute, the author is at this point basically unknown. It was not approved as the official national anthem until 1932. 

“Het Wilhelmus” has 15 eight-line verses (the first verse, and sometimes the sixth, is most commonly performed). Based on older songs, the Wilhelmus takes the form of an acrostic on the name of William of Orange, the leader of the Dutch revolt against Philip II of Spain.

The song’s style resembles that of the work of the Rederijkers (“rhetoricians”), sixteenth-century companies of poets. For example, the first letters of the 15 verses spell the name “Willem van Nassov” (in the original orthography, the modern Dutch version has the acrostic spell “Willem van Nazzov”). The text is also thematically symmetrical, in that verses one and 15 resemble on another in meaning, as do verses two and 14, three and 13, etc., until they converge in the eighth verse, the heart of the song: “Oh David, thou soughtest shelter / From King Saul’s tyranny”. The words of the song also highly resemble the poems in the biblical book of Psalms.  (The English versification to the right is meant to preserve not only the rhyming scheme and rhythm so that it can be sung to the melody, but also the symmetry of the verses and the acrostic.)

Another fact about the anthem that is often in dispute is the use of the word “Duitsen” in the second line of the first verse. Often translated as “German”, William’s birthplace indeed lies in modern-day Germany, however, Germany as a nation would not exist for another 300 years (the area still being known as the “Holy Roman Empire”). Only in modern Dutch has “Duits” come to mean “German” in all uses. start marjan Others have interpreted the word to mean “of the people”, which of course makes it more inclusive of the Dutch people.  end marjan This site prefers “Germanic” as the translation; the original lyrics read “van Duytschen bloet”, “Duytschen” referring not to Germany (as it has been established that there was no such nation at the time), but to the lowlands area, which includes the modern-day Netherlands and certain areas of Germany, including where William of Orange was born; the word therefore highlighted William’s local origins. “Germanic” may be the best modern word to cover the original intent and area inferred.

1. Wilhelmus van Nassouwe
Ben ik van Duitsen bloed
Den vaderland getrouwe
Blijf ik tot in den dood
Een Prince van Oranjen
Ben ik vrij onverveerd
Den Koning van Hispanjen 
Heb ik altijd geëerd

2. In Godes vrees te leven
Heb ik altijd betracht
Daarom ben ik verdreven
Om land om luid’ gebracht
Maar God zal mij regeren
Als een goed instrument
Dat ik zal wederkeren
In mijnen regiment

3. Lijdt u mijn onderzaten
Die oprecht zijn van aard
God zal u niet verlaten
Al zijt gij nu bezwaard
Die vroom begeert te leven
Bidt God nacht ende dag
Dat hij mij kracht wil geven
Dat ik u helpen mag

4. Lijf en goed al te samen
Heb ik u niet verschoond
Mijn broeders hoog van namen
Hebben ‘t u ook vertoond
Graaf Adolf is gebleven
In Friesland in den slag
Zijn ziel in ‘t eeuwig leven
Verwacht den jongsten dag

5. Edel en hoog geboren
Van keizerlijken stam 
Een vorst des rijks verkoren
Als een vroom Christenman
Voor Godes woord geprezen
Heb ik vrij onversaagd
Als een held zonder vrezen
Mijn edel bloed gewaagd

6. Mijn schild ende betrouwen
Zijt gij o God mijn Heer
Op u zo wil ik bouwen
Verlaat mij nimmermeer
Dat ik doch vroom mag blijven
Uw dienaar t’aller stond
Die tirannie verdrijven
Die mij mijn hert doorwondt

7. Van al die mij bezwaren
En mijn vervolgers zijn
Mijn God wilt doch bewaren
Den trouwen dienaar dijn
Dat zal mij niet verrassen
In haren bozen moed
Haar handen niet en wassen
In mijn onschuldig bloed

8. Als David moeste vluchten
Voor Saul den tiran
Zo heb ik moeten zuchten
Met menig edelman
Maar God heeft hem verheven
Verlost uit alder nood
Een koninkrijk gegeven
In Israël zeer groot

9. Na ‘t zuur zal ik ontvangen
Van God mijn Heer dat zoet
Daar na zo doet verlangen
Mijn vorstelijk gemoed: 
Dat is dat ik mag sterven
Met eren in dat veld
Een eeuwig rijk verwerven
Als een getrouwe held

10. Niet doet mij meer erbarmen
In mijnen wederspoed
Dan dat men ziet verarmen
Des Konings landen goed
Dat u de Spanjaards krenken
O edel Neerland zoet
Als ik daar aan gedenke
Mijn edel hert dat bloedt

11. Als een Prins opgezeten
Met mijner heires kracht
Van den tiran vermeten
Heb ik den slag verwacht 
Die bij Maastricht begraven
Bevreesde mijn geweld
Mijn ruiters zag men draven
Zeer moedig door dat veld

12. Zo het den wille des Heren
Op die tijd had geweest
Had ik geern willen keren
Van u dit zwaar tempeest
Maar de Heer van hier boven
Die alle ding regeert
Die men altijd moet loven
En heeft het niet begeerd

13. Zeer prinselijk was gedreven
Mijn prinselijk gemoed
Standvastig is gebleven
Mijn hert in tegenspoed 
Den Heer heb ik gebeden
Van mijnes herten grond
Dat hij mijn zaak wil reden
Mijn onschuld doen bekend

14. Oorlof mijn arme schapen 
Die zijt in groten nood
Uw herder zal niet slapen
Al zijt gij nu verstrooid!
Tot God wilt u begeven
Zijn heilzaam woord neemt aan
Als vrome Christen leven
‘t Zal hier naast zijn gedaan

15. Voor God wil ik belijden
En zijner groter macht
Dat ik tot genen tijden
Den Koning heb veracht
Dat dat ik God den Here
Der hoogster Majesteit
Heb moeten obediëren
In der gerechtigheid

1. William of Nassau, scion
Of an old Germanic line, 
I dedicate undying
Faith to this land of mine.
A prince I am, undaunted,
Of Orange, ever free,
To the king of Spain I’ve granted
A lifelong loyalty.
 
2. I’ve ever tried to live in 
The fear of God’s command 
And therefore I’ve been driven 
From people, home, and land, 
But God, I trust, will rate me 
His willing instrument 
And one day reinstate me 
Into my government.
 
3. Let no despair betray you, 
My subjects true and good. 
The Lord will surely stay you
Though now you are pursued. 
He who would live devoutly
Must pray God day and night
To throw His power about me
As champion of your right.
 
4. Life and my all for others 
I sacrificed, for you! 
And my illustrious brothers 
Proved their devotion too. 
Count Adolf, more’s the pity, 
Fell in the Frisian fray, 
And in the eternal city 
Awaits the judgement day.

5. I, nobly born, descended 
From an imperial stock.
An empire’s prince, defended
(Braving the battle’s shock
Heroically and fearless
As pious Christian ought)
With my life’s blood the peerless
Gospel of God our Lord.
 
6. A shield and my reliance, 
O God, Thou ever wert. 
I’ll trust unto Thy guidance. 
O leave me not ungirt. 
That I may stay a pious.
Servant of Thine for aye
And drive the plagues that try us
And tyranny away.
 
7. My God, I pray thee, save me 
From all who do pursue 
And threaten to enslave me,
Thy trusted servant true.
O Father, do not sanction
Their wicked, foul design,
Don’t let them wash their hands in
This guiltless blood of mine.
 
8. O David, thou soughtest shelter 
From King Saul’s tyranny. 
Even so I fled this welter 
And many a lord with me. 
But God the Lord did save him 
From exile and its hell 
And, in His mercy, gave him
A realm in Israel.
 
9. Fear not ‘t will rain sans ceasing 
The clouds are bound to part. 
I bide that sight so pleasing 
Unto my princely heart,
Which is that I with honour 
Encounter death in war 
And meet in heaven my Donor 
His faithful warrior.
 
10. Nothing so moves my pity 
As seeing through these lands
Field, village, town and city
Pillaged by roving hands.
O that the Spaniards rape thee
My Netherlands so sweet
The thought of that does grip me
Causing my heart to bleed.
 
11. Astride on steed of mettle 
I’ve waited with my host 
The tyrant’s call to battle 
Who durst not do his boast 
For, near Maastricht ensconced, 
He feared the force I wield 
My horsemen saw one bounce it 
Bravely across the field.
 
12. Surely if God had willed it, 
When that fierce tempest blew, 
My power would have stilled it
Or turned its blast from you. 
But He who dwells in heaven, 
Whence all our blessings flow, 
For which aye praise be given, 
Did not desire it so.
 
13. Steadfast my heart remaineth 
In my adversity
My princely courage straineth
All nerves to live and be.
I’ve prayed the Lord my Master
With fervid heart and tense
To save me from disaster
And prove my innocence.
 
14. Alas! my flock. To sever 
Is hard on us. Farewell.
Your Shepherd wakes, wherever
Dispersed you may dwell.
Pray God that He may ease you.
His gospel be your cure.
Walk in the steps of Jesus
This life will not endure.
 
15. Unto the Lord His power 
I do confession make 
That ne’er at any hour 
Ill of the king I spake. 
But unto God, the greatest 
Of Majesties I owe
Obedience first and latest 
For Justice wills it so.

		<string>The design of the Norwegian flag with the Scandinavian cross in the center is similar to the other Nordic flags. In case of Norway, the cross is blue with white framing, placed on a red background. The cross is not isosceles, it reaches the edges of the flag and the shorter arm is located closer to the left side of the flag. The flag is very similar to the Danish Danneborg, which reflects four centuries under the Danish rule. On the other hand, the blue cross points to the long-term ties to Sweden. The flag was designed in 1821 by Frederick Meltzer, but it was not adopted as a state flag until 1898. The colors of the flag that coincide with the French tricolor could be interpreted as an expression of the desire for independence that Norway did not reach until the beginning of the 20th century.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The words for the national anthem, written by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, one of Norway’s great dramatists and poets, were first published in 1859. The original poem had six verses; in 1863 one of the original verses were deleted and three more were added, giving a total of eight verses; the deleted verse was a tribute to King Carl XV, but Bjørnson changed his political views later from monarchism to republicanism, and deleted that verse.  Nowadays, the first verse and last two verses are most commonly sung.

The music was composed by Rikard Nordraak, cousin of Bjørnson and a friend of the famed Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, in 1864. It was first performed later that year for the 50th anniversary of their constitution, and caught on quickly, overtaking “Sønner af Norges” in popularity. It became a part of the reading books in schools all over the country, and was sung by the children in the children’s parades organized by Bjørnson on every 17th of May.

Despite its widespread use as the national anthem, it has never been officially declared as such. It has been the most popular song presented as the anthem since the early twentieth century, and was performed as the national anthem at the time of Norwegian independence in 1905.  Since the summer of 2011, the patriotic song “Mitt lille land” has also been referred to as a “new national anthem”, and has been performed at patriotic events, but has not been used as a national anthem as much as “Ja, vi esker” continues to be.</string>

1. Ja, vi elsker dette landet,
som det stiger frem,
furet, værbitt over vannet,
med de tusen hjem.
Elsker, elsker det og tenker
på vår far og mor
og den saganatt som senker
drømmer på vår jord.
og den saganatt som senker
senker drømmer på vår jord.

2. Dette landet Harald berget
med sin kjemperad,
dette landet Håkon verget
medens Øyvind kvad;
Olav på det landet malte
korset med sitt blod,
fra dets høye Sverre talte
Roma midt imot.
fra dets høye Sverre talte
talte Roma midt imot. 

3. Bønder sine økser brynte
hvor en hær dro frem,
Tordenskiold langs kysten lynte,
så det lystes hjem.
Kvinner selv stod opp og strede
som de vare menn;
andre kunne bare grede,
men det kom igjen!
andre kunne bare grede,
men det kom det kom igjen!

4. Visstnok var vi ikke mange,
men vi strakk dog til,
da vi prøvdes noen gange,
og det stod på spill;
ti vi heller landet brente
enn det kom til fall;
husker bare hva som hendte
ned på Fredrikshald!
husker bare hva som hendte
hendte ned på Fredrikshald!

5. Hårde tider har vi døyet,
ble til sist forstøtt;
men i verste nød blåøyet
frihet ble oss født.
Det gav faderkraft å bære
hungersnød og krig,
det gav døden selv sin ære –
og det gav forlik.
det gav døden selv sin ære –
og det gav det gav forlik.

6. Fienden sitt våpen kastet,
opp visiret for,
vi med undren mot ham hastet,
ti han var vår bror.
Drevne frem på stand av skammen
gikk vi søderpå;
nu vi står tre brødre sammen,
og skal sådan stå!
nu vi står tre brødre sammen,
sammen og skal sådan stå!

7. Norske mann i hus og hytte,
takk din store Gud!
Landet ville han beskytte,
skjønt det mørkt så ut.
Alt hva fedrene har kjempet,
mødrene har grett,
har den Herre stille lempet
så vi vant vår rett.
har den Herre stille lempet
så vi vant vi vant vår rett.

8. Ja, vi elsker dette landet,
som det stiger frem,
furet, værbitt over vannet,
med de tusen hjem.
Og som fedres kamp har hevet
det av nød til seir,
også vi, når det blir krevet,
for dets fred slår leir.

for dets fred dets fred slår leir.

1. Yes, we love this country
as it rises forth,
rugged, weathered, above the sea,
with the thousands of homes.
Love, love it and think
of our father and mother
and the saga night that sends
dreams to our earth.
and the saga night that sends

2. This country Harald united
with his army of heroes,
this country Håkon protected
whilst Øyvind sung;
upon the country Olav painted
with his blood the cross,
from its heights Sverre spoke
up against Rome.

3. Farmers their axes sharpened
wherever an army advanced,
Tordenskiold along the coastline thundered
so that we could see it back home.
Even women stood up and fought
as if they were men;
others could only cry
but that soon would end!
others could only cry
but that soon, that soon would end!

4. Sure, we were not many
but we were enough,
when we were tested sometimes,
and it was at stake;
we would rather burn our land
than to declare defeat;
just remember what happened
down at Fredrikshald!
just remember what happened
what happened down at Fredrikshald!

5. Hard times we have coped with,
were at last disowned;
but in the worst distress, blue-eyed
freedom was to us born.
It gave (us) father’s strength to carry
famine and war,
it gave death itself its honour –
and it gave reconciliation.
it gave death itself its honour –
and it gave, it gave reconciliation.

6. The enemy threw away his weapon,
up the visor went,
we, in wonder, to him hastened,
because he was our brother.
Driven forth to a stand by shame
we went to the south;
now we three brothers stand united,
and shall stand like that!
now we three brothers stand united,
united, and shall stand like that!

7. Norseman in house and cabin,
thank your great God!
The country he wanted to protect,
although things looked dark.
All the fights fathers have fought,
and the mothers have wept,
the Lord has quietly moved
so we won our rights.
the Lord has quietly moved
so we won, we won our rights.

8. Yes, we love this country
as it rises forth,
rugged, weathered, above the sea,
with those thousand homes.
And as the fathers’ struggle has raised
it from need to victory,
even we, when it is demanded,
for its peace, its peace will encamp

		<string>Unconventionally shaped flag of Nepal, which was adopted in 1962 together with Nepalese constitution, is made up of two orthogonal triangles where one is placed on the top of the other, both lined with a blue stripe. This shape emerged from a combination of two flags of competing branches of Rana dynasty that once ruled this country. The upper triangle bears a white silhouette of the moon, which represents the royal family and its power. The lower triangle that holds the symbol of the sun stands for Rana family and the political power. The combination of these two symbologies should represent the hope for Nepalese independence to last as long as there is the sun and the moon. The flag´s serrate shape also evokes the peaks of the Himalayas. Red color of the background indicates energy.</string>

		<string>After the revolutions of spring 2006 against the monarchy, Nepal sought to replace its pro-monarchy anthem with a new one in a public contest. The winner, Pradeep Kumar Rai (writing under the pen name व्याकुल माइला (Byakul Maila)) was selected from 1,272 submissions. During the submission process, Rai and his family were interviewed several times to prove he was not a monarchist, since he one edited a book of poetry that contained a submission from the king.

The new anthem was officially declared on August 3, 2007.  Despite the lyrics speaking of diversity, peace, and unity, the anthem is seen as highly tied to the Maoist government that controls Nepal, whereas some of the Maoists themselves want a more revolutionary anthem.

		<string>The base of the flag of Nauru, the smallest independent country in the world, which has been adopted in 1976 when the country achieved independence, consists of a dark blue sheet. The sheet is crossed by a yellow stripe in its middle and below the stripe and closer to the left part of the flag a twelve-pointed white star is placed. Each chip represents one of the twelve tribes that used to inhabit the island, although two of them do not exist already. Yellow stripe symbolizes the equator and the star depicts the position of the island against the equator. The blue color of the sheet should remind the Pacific Ocean, which surrounds the island. The design of the flag was chosen through a public competition, where a draft of an Australian designer won.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The music for Nauru’s anthem was composed by Laurence Hicks, an Australian squadron leader.  The lyrics were by Margaret Hendrie, a Nauruan writer. It was adopted upon 1968 independence from Australia.</string>

		<string>At first sight, the flag of New Zealand reflects its colonial past. Both Union Jack flag in the upper left corner and the blue background point to former ties to the Great Britain. Four red stars with white framing symbolize a constellation of the Southern Cross, which dominates the sky there. The same motif can be found on the Australian flag, so it highlights the fact that both countries are located in the Pacific Ocean in mutual geographic proximity. Officially, the blue color expresses blue sea and clear sky in the vicinity of New Zealand. The flag was adopted on 24th March 1902, but it was already designed as a naval flag in 1869.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>New Zealand holds a unique position in the world in that it officially has two national anthems of equal standing – “God Defend New Zealand” and “God Save The Queen”.  (The lone other example in the world is Denmark, where the royal and national anthems have equal status in the country.)

“God Defend New Zealand” was written by Irish-born poet and New Zealand citizen Thomas Bracken in 1870, and the music composed by John Joseph Woods as a result of a newspaper contest in 1876. (Woods actually composed the music in one sitting, starting as soon as he read about the contest and not resting until he was finished.)  Gaining popularity in the first half of the twentieth century, it was adopted as New Zealand’s national song in 1940 (New Zealand’s centennial year), but “God Save the Queen” remained the sole national anthem. A petition in 1976 prompted the government to seek royal assent to make “God Defend New Zealand” as a national anthem on equal status with “God Save the Queen”. This was signed into law by the Queen on November 21, 1977.

The Māori words, officially translated numerous times, are made to fit the melody. As such, they don’t translate exactly to the English lyrics. A translation of the official Māori lyrics is provided on the right hand side of this page. The anthem is commonly sung lately with the first verse in Māori followed by the first verse in English.

 

God Save the Queen has been New Zealand’s official anthem since 1840, when it became a British colony. The second verse, which is in a more militaristic vein, and the third verse, have been replaced in New Zealand with a “Commonwealth verse“, usually used when more than one stanza is needed. Despite being declared an “official anthem” by the New Zealand government, along with “God Defend New Zealand”, “God Save the Queen” is rarely sung in the country, it is used in the capacity that a royal anthem would be used (that is, when a member of the royal family is present, or their representative, or allegiance to the crown is to be demonstrated by the performance).  As such, “God Defend New Zealand” is much more commonly heard.</string>

		<string>The flag of Oman is composed of three horizontal stripes in white, red and green colors and red vertical stripe on the left side of the flag. These colors are traditional for Arab nations and symbolize the unity among them. At the top of the left red stripe, a white coat of arms of sultans is placed. It portrays two crossed sabers in decorated scabbards, dagger and pylons. Another interpretation of the colors says that red is to commemorate the Islamic Ibadijs, white is the color of peace and green represents the mountains Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountains in translation) and the Muslim faith of the local people. The flag has been used with slight modifications since 1970.</string>

		<string>The flag of Panama is divided into four fields - along one diagonal there is a fully blue and red field, along the second diagonal there are two white boxes bearing blue and red star. Panama has always been of interest of the world powers for its strategic geographical position. Firstly, the Spanish ruled the country, later Colombians, and it did not became independent until 1903. Shortly after that the United States began to build the Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914. The flag designed by President Amador Guerra should express a desire to solve the structural problems of domestic policy that have been caused by considerable external interventions. Blue and red color represent the democrats and socialists and the white background of the fields with stars stands for peace.</string>

CHORUS:
Alcanzamos por fin la victoria
En el campo feliz de la unión;
Con ardientes fulgores de gloria
Se ilumina la nueva nación. 

1. Es preciso cubrir con un velo
Del pasado el calvario y la cruz;
Y que adorne el azul de tu cielo
De concordia la espléndida luz. 

El progreso acaricia tus lares.
Al compás de sublime canción,
Ves rugir a tus pies ambos mares
Quedan rumbo a tu noble misión. 

Chorus 

2. En tu suelo cubierto de flores
A los besos del tibio terral,
Terminaron guerreros fragores;
Sólo reina el amor fraternal. 

Adelante la pica y la pala,
Al trabajo sin más dilación,
Y seremos así prez y gala
De este mundo feraz de Colón.

CHORUS:
We finally attained victory
In the happy field of union.
With glowing splendour,
The new nation is illumined.

1. It is necessary to veil with a curtain
The Calvary and Cross of the past,
And for you to adorn the azure of your skies
With the splendid light of concord.

Progress fondly touches your homes,
In time with the music of a sublime song.
You see, roaring at your feet, two oceans
Which give direction to your noble mission.

Chorus 

2. On your flower-covered soil,
Kissed by the warm breeze,
Warlike clamour has ended
And only brotherly love reigns.

Ahead, with spade and stone-mason’s hammer!
To work, without more delay!
In this way we shall be the honour and glory
Of this fertile land of Columbus.

		<string>The flag of Peru consists of three horizontal stripes, where the side ones are red and the middle one is white. In the center of the white stripe, a shield taken from the national character that was designed before 1825 by José Georgiou Parades is placed. The shield is divided into three fields, where the first one depicts vicuna – a national animal of Peru belonging to the same family as camel does. Next to vicuna, there is a portrait of cinchona tree, from which alkaloid quinine, which is used to cure malaria, is extracted. At the bottom of the coat of arms, a horn full of coins that should point to the mineral wealth of the country is displayed.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The first leader of Peru declared a contest to compose a new national anthem shortly after independence. The winning anthem, entitled “Marcha Nacional” (National March) was accepted immediately as the new national anthem, and was sung for the first time in  the Principal Theatre of Lima on the night of 24 September 1821. In the intervening years, there were efforts to alter the lyrics (partly due to the anthem’s anti-Spanish tone) but in 1913 the lyrics were declared to be sacrosanct and not to be rewritten (previous efforts to do so didn’t catch on in popularity anyway).  Despite this, the anthem continued to be revised in the ensuing decades.  Different words for the first verse, then the second and third verses, were written, with varying degrees of success, during different presidential regimes but after their terms were over, the lyrics reverted back to the original ones.

In 2005, it was determined that the first verse, which was most commonly sung at the time, was not written by José de la Torre Ugarte, but it had become part of the popular ethos by this time, as well as being part of the 1913 law regarding the intangibleness of the anthem.  It was also determined that the original fifth stanza had been excluded from the anthem, and was reinstated as the sixth stanza, making seven stanzas in all.  In 2009, the government declared the last verse to be the official verse to be sung when the anthem is played.</string>

CHORUS:
Somos libres, seámoslo siempre,
y antes niegue sus luces 
sus luces, sus luces el sol
que  faltemos al voto solemne
que la patria al eterno elevó.  
que  faltemos al voto solemne
que la patria al eterno elevó.  
que  faltemos al voto solemne
que la patria al eterno elevó.  

1. Largo tiempo el peruano oprimido
la ominosa cadena arrastró;
condenado a una cruel servidumbre
largo tiempo, largo tiempo 
largo tiempo en silencio gimió.  
Más apenas el grito sagrado
¡Libertad! en sus costas se oyó,
la indolencia de esclavo sacude,
la humillada , la humillada
la humillada cerviz levantó  
cerviz levantó.  
 
Chorus

2. Y al estruendo de broncas cadenas
que escuchamos tres siglos de horror,
de los libres al grito sagrado
que oyó atónito el mundo, cesó.  
Por doquier San Martín inflamado,
libertad, libertad, pronunció,
y meciendo su base los andes
la anunciaron, también, a una voz.  
 
Chorus

3. Con su influjo los pueblos despiertan
y cual rayo corrió la opinión;
desde el istmo a las tierras del fuego
desde el fuego a la helada región.
Todos juran romper el enlace  
que natura a ambos mundos negó,
y quebrar ese cetro que España,
reclinaba orgulloso en los dos.  
 
Chorus

4. Lima, cumple ese voto solemne,
y, severa, su enojo mostró,
al tirano impotente lanzando
que intentaba alargar su opresión.    
A su esfuerzo saltaron los grillos
y los surcos que en sí reparó,
le atizaron el odio y venganza
que heredara de su Inca y Señor.  
 
Chorus

5. Compatriotas no más, verla esclava
si humillada tres siglos gimió,
para siempre jurémosla libre
manteniendo su propio esplendor.    
Nuestros brazos, hasta hoy desarmados
estén siempre cebando el cañón,
que algún día las playas de Iberia,
sentirán de su estruendo el terror.  
 
Chorus

6. Excitemos los celos de España
pues presiente con mengua y furor
que en concurso de grandes naciones
nuestra patria entrará en parangón.
En la lista que de éstas se forme
llenaremos primero el reglón
que el tirano ambicioso Iberino,
que la América toda asoló.
 
Chorus

7. En su cima los andes sostengan
la bandera o pendón bicolor
que a los siglos anuncie el esfuerzo
que ser libres, por siempre nos dio.
A su sombra vivamos tranquilos,
y al nacer por sus cumbres el sol,
renovemos el gran juramento
que rendimos al Dios de Jacob.

CHORUS:
We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so!
and let the sun rather deny its light
its lights, its lights…the sun!
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal
Before allow us to break the solemn vow
which the motherland elevated to the Eternal.

1. For a long time the oppressed Peruvian
dragged the ominous chain;
sentenced to a cruel servitude
for a long time, for a long time
for a long time in silence he moaned.
But as soon as the sacred cry
“Liberty!” was heard on its coasts,
he shook off the indolence of slavery,
the humiliated, the humiliated
the humiliated neck he raised
the humiliated neck he raised
the neck he raised!.
 
Chorus

2. Now the roar of rough chains
that we had heard for three centuries of horror
from the free, at the sacred cry
that the world heard astonished, ceased.
Everywhere the inflamed San Martín
“Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced;
and the Andes, rocking their base,
announced it as well, in unison.
 
Chorus

3. With its influx the peoples woke up,
and like lighting ran the opinion;
from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego,
and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region.
Everyone vowed to break the link
that Nature denied to both worlds,
and break the sceptre that Spain
had reclined, proud, on both.
 
Chorus

4. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow,
and, severe, her anger showed
by throwing out the powerless tyrant,
who had been trying to extend his oppression.
On her endeavor the shackles cracked,
and the furrows that she had repaired in herself
stirred up her hatred and vengeance,
inherited from her Inca and Lord.
 
Chorus

5. Countrymen, may we see her a slave no more.
If for three centuries she moaned, humiliated,
forever may we vow that she be free,
maintaining her own splendor.
Our arms, until today unarmed,
be they always readying the cannon,
that some day the beaches of Iberia
will feel the horror of its roar.
 
Chorus

6. May we arouse the jealousy of Spain
since it has a premonition, with want and furor,
that in a contest of great nations
our country will enter in comparison.
On the list formed by these
we shall fill the line first,
ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant,
who devastated all of America.
 
Chorus

7. On its summit may the Andes sustain
the two-color flag or standard,
may it announce to the centuries the effort
that being free gave us forever.
Under its shadow may we live calmly
and, at the sun’s birth over its summits,
may we renew the great oath
we rendered to the God of Jacob. 
 
Chorus

At the bottom part, five stars depicting the Southern Cross constellation following flags of Australia and New Zealand are placed. The upper red part of the flag is dominated by a golden silhouette of a bird of paradise in flight, which is the national symbol of the country. The red, yellow and black colors have been used by the indigenous population for decorating objects of folk art for a long time.

		<string>The flag of the Philippines has been adopted in 1946 when the country gained independence from the US. It was designed in the 19th century by the leader of the uprising against the Spanish domination Emilio Aguinaldo, who defeated the enemy on 28 May 1898 at the battle of Alapan. Tricolor of white, red and blue was chosen with reference to the United States used to rule the country. Thus, the flag is composed of two horizontal stripes of red, blue, and a white triangle in the left part of the flag. Three golden stars in each of the peaks of the triangle represent the three main islands of the Philippines - Mindanao, Luzon and Visayas. In the middle of the wedge, there is a golden sun with eight rays in the shape of a sword, symbolizing the first eight founding provinces. Interesting fact is that the flag can indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red stripe on top.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>On June 5, 1898, a week before Philippine independence would be declared, Julian Felipe, a local pianist from Kawit, Cavite, arrived at the home of Maximo Inocencio, one of Cavite’s thirteen martyrs during the revolution. Upon his arrival, the leader of the revolution, General Emilio Aguinaldo, asked Felipe to play a march written by a Filipino in Hong Kong. However, Aguinaldo was not satisfied with this march. Recognizing Felipe’s skills, he asked him to compose a more soul-rousing tune that would install courage and patriotism in the hearts of every Filipino.

On June 11, the day before the declaration of independence, Felipe arrived again and played his tune to the revolutionary leaders. The leaders unanimously approved it as the national hymn. Felipe called his work the “Marcha Filipina Magdalo.” The next day, Felipe’s tune was played during the hoisting of the Philippine flag at the historic window at the Aguinaldo mansion. The march was renamed the “Marcha Nacional Filipina,” and immediately became the National Anthem. However, the anthem still lacked words. The next year, a young soldier named José Palma penned the poem “Filipinas” in Spanish, to match the music of the anthem. It was adopted as the official lyrics.

The Philippines were now under American rule, and as such, a suitable English translation was to be made of the anthem. The first translation was made by Paz Marquez Benitez of the University of the Philippines. However, the most popular version was written by Mary A. Lane and Senator Camillo Osias, known as the “Philippine Hymn”. On December 5, 1938, the Philippine Congress passed Commonwealth Act 382, which made the anthem’s English words and Felipe’s music official.

A Tagalog (the Filipino language) version of the words started appearing in the 1940’s. In 1948, the Department of Education approved “O Sintang Lupa” (O Beloved Land) as the national anthem’s Filipino words. In 1954, Education Secretary Gregorio Hernandez, Jr., created a committee to revise the words. The new version, entitled “Lupang Hinirang,” was adopted (a minor revision was made in 1962), and is still in use today. Since the passage of the 1998 law about the national symbols (RA 8491), the national anthem can only be sung in Tagalog (the national language) and using only the music composed by Felipe. However, that has not prevented other translations from being created, such as Ilonggo.

		<string>At first glance, the flag of Pakistan suggests that Pakistan is a Muslim state. A rectangular leaf carries two traditional symbols of Islam on a green background - a white crescent and five-pointed star, where the crescent indicates progress and the star stands for knowledge and light. The white stripe on the left side of the flag is supposed to represent Pakistani minorities (Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists), and thus indirectly expresses religious tolerance in the country. White, together with the green color, also marks peace and prosperity. The flag was inspired by the flag of All-India Muslim League, which pushed for the division of British India into two separate states in 1947 - Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>info from sources in Wiehler emailShortly before independence, an interim anthem hastily written by Jagnnath Azad, a Hindu, was put into use at the time of Pakistan’s independence in August, 1947.Wiehler end  Then in December, 1948, a committee to select a national anthem for Pakistan was formed. A member of the committee, Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla, was asked to produce a composition. Mr. Chagla’s background in music involves study in both western and eastern music, and characteristics of eastern music can be found in the anthem.

After some “test runs” which included performances for the Prime Minister, for a visiting head of state, for the Prime Minister’s visit to the United States, and finally for the committee itself, it was then approved by the anthem committee in August 1950 and gained official recognition in December 1953. The words, written in a highly Persianized form of the national language, Urdu, were composed by another member of the committee and officially approved in August 1954.  The anthem is sometimes referred to by its first line (“Pak sarzamin shad bad” (Blessed Be The Sacred Land))

		<string>The Polish flag consists of two equally broad stripes – red one at the bottom and white one on top. The colors are derived from the Polish emblem - a white eagle on a red background. This emblem dates back to the Middle Ages, and although the eagle was removed from the flag, white and red became the traditional colors of Poles. Polish identity has undergone numerous pitfalls over the centuries, therefore these colors have been of great importance for the Polish people, regardless of the current political situation. The symbolism of these colors has many interpretations. It may denote a white eagle flying over the sunset, or connection of the human spirit with the blood shed for freedom. Another interpretation is the wish of the Polish to live in peace and socialism.</string>

		<string>The Polish national anthem was written in July 1797 in Reggio near Bolonia by Józef Wybicki, one of the organisers of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski’s Polish Army in Italy. The theme of the original poem was a novel idea in the era of the nation state (that is, most European nations were made up of eponymous nationalities), that the nation does not need a territory to be a nation, it only needs a group of people.  This idea was a timely one, as Poland had only been partitioned out of existence only two years earlier.  Several more times in subsequent Polish history would an independent Polish nation appear then disappear from the map, which could explain why the song resonates with Poles even today.  The original poem also mentions several Polish war heroes of the time, as well as heroes of past Polish wars; also Napoleon is mentioned, as the commanding officer of Dąbrowski and as an example to be held up.

The source of the melody is unclear; it is usually ascribed to Michal Kleofas Oginski, but this has not been determined with certainty. It is most likely based on an anonymous fok song, due to the unusual mazurka tempo (which is often played at a faster rate than most anthems); mazurkas originated in Poland and have always been heavily associated with that nation.

Its familiar mazurka melody and its message – a call to join the fight for independence – inspired numerous 19th century patriotic songs and national hymns of the Slavonic nations under foreign rule (some of which would later become Yugoslavia, which could explain the similar melody of the former Yugoslav anthem.) The opening line of the lyrics was also borrowed by Ukraine (which, of course, speaks of the Ukraine not perishing rather than Poland.) In the early years after Poland’s revival in 1918, during the debate about the choice of the national anthem, several candidates were considered. On February 28, 1927 the choice of “Dąbrowski’s Mazurka” as the national anthem was officially announced.

		<string>“Fida’i” was declared the anthem of Palestinians by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (an organization charged with the governance of Arab Palestinians) in 1972, in advance of their 1988 declaration of independence. The anthem, also known as the “Anthem of the Intifada” (or “Anthem of the Palestinian Revolution”) firas startwas written by Said Al Muzayin (also known as Fata Al Thawra (“The Rebel Boy”)), and its music was composed by Egyptian maestro Ali Ismael.firas end  While being the official national anthem for use in the areas currently controlled by the Palestinian government, “Mawtini” is considered an “unofficial Palestinian anthem”, popular with many Palestinians, and was considered the Palestinian anthem before “Fida’i” was adopted.

firas startThe word “فدائي” (fida’i), in addition to being the anthem’s title, appears several times in the anthem as well.  The term is difficult to express in a single word or two in English; it refers to a man (the feminine form is “fida’iya”, plural is “fida’iyeen”) who is willing to sacrifice his life. The object that he will sacrifice to can be anything, his lover, tribe, religion, etc., but in the modern sense it is usually meant as a sacrifice to your country.firas end  It has been translated various ways in the anthem, depending on context, the terms “sacrificer”, “resistor”, “freedom fighter” or “revolutionary” could all express the intended meaning to an extent.

Special thanks to: Firas Al-Taher for some of the information about this anthem as well as the Romanized Arabic lyrics.

		<string>The Portuguese flag is composed of green and red stripe, and the national coat of arms. The stripes don´t have the same width and the center of the coat of arms is placed at the borderline between these two stripes. The red color symbolizes the blood shed during the Portuguese revolution in 1910 and the green color stands for hope. Five blue emblems on a white field are allegedly reminder of five Moorish kings, who the first Portuguese king Afonso Henriques had to defeat. Its cross position points to the Christian tradition. Seven castles on the larger red emblem symbolize the seven castles that Alfons had to conquer. Golden navigation device in the background of the coat of arms refers to the Portuguese past as a colonial power.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>“A Portuguesa” was written in response to the British ultimatum in 1890 to Portugal regarding territorial control of Africa. Anywhere there was protests against the monarchy as a result, “A Portuguesa” could be heard. The song still echoes the original intent, the verses and especially the chorus speak of a call to arms, the third verse speaks of “insults” and “embarrassment” (which is how the Portuguese saw the British ultimatum), and the original last line of the chorus read “Contra os bretões marchar, marchar” (Against the British we march, we march!). With the success of the Republicans in ousting the monarchy and replacing them with a democratic government in 1910, “A Portuguesa” was approved as a national anthem shortly after; it is the first verse and chorus that is usually presented as the anthem. 

In 1956, there were a number of variations of the anthem, not just in its melodic line but also in the instrumentation. Recognizing this, the government named a commission charged with determining the official version of “A Portuguesa.” This commission prepared a proposal which, approved by the Council of Ministers on 16 July 1957, remains in effect to this day.</string>

		<string>The flag of Palau has been adopted on 1st January 1981, when the archipelago decided to separate from the territory of the Pacific Islands and it was proclaimed a republic under the protection of the United States. The flag is composed of a pale blue sheet and a yellow circle centered slightly toward the left side of the flag. When the flag is hung it creates an impression that the circle is located right in the center of the flag. Blue color symbolizes the Pacific Ocean that surrounds the islands and the yellow circle allegedly resembles the full moon, which is an important period for the islanders. They believe that activities such as fishing, planting and harvesting are much more effective during this moon-phase.</string>

		<string>Shortly before adopting its first constitution in 1981, Palau’s anthem was officially adopted.  At the time part of the  U. S. administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, independence was gained in 1994. The lyrics of the anthem are combined from several authors.</string>

		<string>The flag of Paraguay has been adopted in 1842 by President Rodriguez de Francia, a great admirer of France. That is why he chose the colors of the French tricolor for the national flag, however, he decided to place the stripes horizontally. The flag is unique because of its obverse and reverse sides are different. The center of the white stripe on the front of the flag bears a national coat of arms where a yellow five-pointed star surrounded by a green wreath and an inscription "República del Paraguay" is placed. Allegedly, the star was shining over the capital city Asuncion in 1811 when the independence of Paraguay was declared. The reverse side is decorated with an emblem of the Ministry of Finance and an inscription "Paz y Justicia" at the same place.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Paraguay’s first anthem was adopted in 1831, called “Tetã purahéi”, and written by Anastacio Rolón completely in the native Guarnaní language (the ruler of the time, José Gaspar Rodríguez,  refused it to be translated into Spanish, and insisted that it always be performed in Guarnaní).   A later president, Carlos Antonio López, translated it into Spanish in 1845 as the “Himno de la independencia” (Anthem of Independence) as a literal translation of the Guarnaní.  It is unknown who wrote the music, or what it was.

During López’ presidency, he requested Francisco Esteban Acuña de Figueroa, the lyricist of Uruguay’s anthem, to write a new anthem for the country.  It was completed on May 20, 1846 and approved as the national anthem that year.  It is unknown who created the original music of the anthem (some sources list Francisco José Debali, who was also the composer of Uruguay’s anthem), but in 1934, Paraguayan composer Remberto Giménez rearranged and developed the version of the anthem in use today.

Paraguay’s anthem is a classic example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. The seven verses of the anthem also resemble other nations’ anthems of this type, for example, the first three verses of Paraguay’s anthem, recalling its history and specific events, is very similar to the theme of Honduras‘ anthem, whereas the fourth verse which praises the national symbols, and the last three verses, which are a call to patriotism, are common themes in these type of anthems.

1. A los pueblos de América, infausto  
tres centurias un cetro oprimió,  
Mas un día soberbio surgiendo,  
¡basta!, dijo … y el cetro rompió.
Nuestros padres, lidiando, grandiosos,  
ilustraron su gloria marcial,  
y trozada la augusta diadema,  
enalzaron el gorro triunfal.

¡Paraguayos, República, o muerte!  
Nuestro brío nos dio libertad:  
ni opresores, ni siervos alientan  
donde reinen unión e igualdad.

dos caudillos de nombre y valer,  
que rival, cual Romulo y Remo  
dividieron gobierno y poder.
Largos años, cual Febo entre nubes  
vióse oculta la perla del Sud,  
hoy un Héroe grandioso aparece  
realzando su gloria y virtud …

Chorus

3. Con aplauso la Europa y el Mundo  
la saludan y aclaman también

Cuando en torno rugió la Discordia  
que otros pueblos fatal devoró,  
paraguayos; el suelo sagrado,  
con sus alas un ángel cubrió.

Chorus

4. ¡Oh, cuán pura, de lauro ceñida,  
dulce patria, te ostentas así!  
En tu enseña se ven los colores  
del zafiro, diamante y rubí.
En tu escudo que el sol ilumina  
bajo el gorro se mira al león.  
Doble imagen de fuertes y libres  
y de glorias, recuerdo y blasón.

Chorus

5. De la tumba del vil feudalismo  
se alza libre la patria Deidad;  
opresores ¡doblad la rodilla!,  
compatriotas ¡el Himno entonad!
Suene el grito: ¡República o muerte!  
Nuestros pechos lo exhalen con fe  
y sus ecos repiten los montes,  
cual gigantes poniéndose en pie.

Chorus

6. Libertad y Justicia defiende  
nuestra Patria, ¡Tiranos, oíd!  
De sus fueros la carta sagrada  
su heroísmo sustenta en la lid.
Contra el mundo si el mundo se opone,  
si intentare su prenda insultar,  
batallando vengarla sabremos  
¡Oh, abrazados con ella expirar!

Chorus

7. Alza, oh, pueblo, tu espada esplendente  
que fulmina destellos  de Dios,  
no hay más medio que libre o esclavo  
y un abismo divide a los dos.
En las auras el himno resuene,  
repitiendo con eco triunfal:  
¡A los Libres, perinclita gloria!  
¡A La Patria, laurel inmortal!

1. For three centuries a reign oppressed
The unhappy peoples of America,
But one day, their anger aroused, they said:
“An end to this!” and broke the reign.
Our forefathers, fighting magnificently,
Displayed their martial glory,
And when the august diadem was shattered,
They raised the triumphal cap of liberty.

CHORUS:
Paraguayans, Republic or death!
It was our strength that gave us our final liberty.
Neither tyrants nor slaves can continue,
Where unity and equality reign,
Where unity and equality reign.

2. A new Rome, the Fatherland shall proudly display
Two leaders of name and valor
Who, rivals, like Romulus and Remus
Divided government and power.
Long years, during which Phoebus in the clouds
Saw darken the pearl of the South,
Today a grand hero appears
Raising up again her glory and virtue…

Chorus

3. Europe and the world salute her with applause
And also acclaim
Invincible bastion of heroism,
Magnificent Eden of riches.
(But) when discord rumbled all around
Which fatally devoured other Peoples,
Paraguayans, the sacred ground
Was covered by an angel with its wings.

Chorus

4. Oh, how pure, of laurel girded
Sweet Fatherland, in this manner you show yourself.
In your ensign one sees the colors
Of sapphire, diamond, and ruby.
In your coat of arms, which the Sun illuminates,
Under the cap, one sees the lion.
Double image of the strong and the free,
And of glories, the memory and crest.

Chorus

5. From the tomb of vile feudalism
The national Deity rises free;
Oppressors, bend your knees!
Compatriots, entone the hymn!
Sound the cry, “Republic or death”!
Our breasts exhale it with faith,
And the mountains repeat its echoes
Like giants arising.

Chorus

6. Our Fatherland defends liberty and justice;
Tyrants: listen!
The laws in its sacred charter
Will sustain its heroism in the fight.
Against the world, if the world opposes it,
If the world dares to insult her security,
Battling to avenge we shall know her
Or die embracing her.

Chorus

7. Arise, oh People, your splendid sword
That strikes with sparkles of God,
There is no middle ground between free or slave
And an abyss divides the two.
In the gentle breezes the Hymn resounds,
Repeating with triumphal echo:
For the free, renowned glory!
For the Fatherland, immortal laurel!

		<string>The flag of Qatar was adopted in 1981 when Qatar became an independent state. Maroon color on the right side of the flag evokes the sharp sun's rays of Qatar´s sun hitting the red cloth, or it may refer to the natural dye frequently used in Qatar which has a similar color. Chestnut stripe is separated from the right one by nine white teeth. Originally, the flag was whole red and white stripe was adopted as a sign that the country is not pirated any longer. At first glance, the flag may be confused with the flag of Bahrain, but at closer look we can find several differences. The red color of Bahrain´s flag is lighter, it has only five instead of nine teeth, and the ratio of the sides is quite different as well.</string>

CHORUS:
Swearing by God who erected the sky
Swearing by God who spread the light
Qatar will always be free
Sublimed by the souls of the sinceres
 
1. Procede thou on the manners of the ascendants
And advance on Prophet’s guidance
In my heart,
Qatar is an epic of glory and dignity
Qatar is land of the early men
Who protect us at time of distress,
Doves they can be at times of peace,
Warriors they are at times of sacrifice

		<string>The Romanian flag consists of tricolor of vertical stripes - dark blue one, yellow one and red one. These colors, characteristic of Moldavia and Wallachia, appeared in 1834 for the first time. The flag is very similar to the flag of Chad with the difference that Chad´s blue stripe is darker. During several periods, there was a national coat of arms in the center of the flag. Romania was a long time under the domination of the Soviet Union and, moreover, under the baton of the Ceausescu the regime was very close to tyranny. Ceausescu was overthrown and executed in 1989 and people began to prefer the flag without the coat of arms as an expression of resistance against the previous regime. Shortly after, this version of the flag was adopted officially.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Written during the 1848 revolution by Andrei Mureşianu and set to the music of Anton Pann by Gheorghe Ucenescu and originally titled “Un răsunet” (An Echo), the poem’s theme of revolution, liberty, and patriotism, quickly became popular with Romanians, especially in subsequent national struggles, earning the song the nickname of the “Romanian Marseillaise“.  It was first used as a national anthem by the short-lived Moldavian Democratic Republic in 1917-1918 (and was the first anthem in use by independent Moldova from 1991-1994) and was long regarded as an unofficial Romanian anthem.  It was heard frequently during the protests against the communist government in late 1989 and was officially confirmed as the national anthem in the spring of 1990.  The original work has eleven verses, but only four (verses 1, 2, 4, and 11) are usually performed as the official lyrics (although on special occasions, such as National Anthem Day (July 29, the anniversary of its first performance in 1848), the full lyrics can sometimes be heard).</string>

1. Deşteaptă-te, române, din somnul cel de moarte,  
În care te-adânciră barbarii de tirani  
Acum ori niciodată croieşte-ţi altă soarte,  
La care să se-nchine şi cruzii tăi duşmani.  
      
2. Acum ori niciodată să dăm dovezi în lume  
Că-n aste mâni mai curge un sânge de roman,  
Şi că-n a noastre piepturi păstrăm cu fală-un nume  
Triumfător în lupte, un nume de Traian.  

4. Priviţi, măreţe umbre, Mihai, Ştefan, Corvine,  
Româna naţiune, ai voştri strănepoţi,  
Cu braţele armate, cu focul vostru-n vine,  
“Viaţa-n libertate ori moarte” strigă toţi.  
  
11. Preoţi, cu crucea-n frunte căci oastea e creştină,  
Deviza-i libertate şi scopul ei preasfânt.  
Murim mai bine-n luptă, cu glorie deplină,  
Decât să fim sclavi iarăşi în vechiul nost’pământ.

1. Wake up, Romanian, from your deadly sleep
Into which you’ve been sunk by the barbaric tyrants
Now, or never, your fate renew,
To which your enemies will bow to.

2. Now or never let’s give proof to the world
That in these veins still flows a Roman blood,
That in our chests we still maintain our pride in a name
The victor in his battles, the name of Trajan!

4. Watch on, shadows of highnesses, Mihai, Stefan, Corvinus,
The Romanian Nation, your great grandchildren,
With weapons in their arms, with your fire in their veins,
“Life in freedom or death!” shout all.

11. Priests, lead with your crucifixes! Because our army is Christian,
The motto is Liberty and its goal is holy,
Better to die in battle, in full glory,
Than to once again be slaves upon our ancient ground!

		<string>The Serbian flag is composed of traditional Pan-Slavic tricolor of red, blue, and white stripe. However, the color sequence is reversed compared to the other Slavic flags. Moreover, on the left side of the flag, there is a national coat of arms, which depicts a white double-headed eagle holding a red shield placed on red background. Above the head of the eagle, a crown inspired by the crown of Serbian tsars is situated. Allegedly, the Serbs intended to take over the Russian flag as a sign of gratitude for providing a war assistance. However, they did not bring the original flag home and after they had returned they ordered the stripes incorrectly. The flag is one of the newest ones since Serbia was not established as an independent state until 2006, when Montenegro decided to split up in a referendum.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Written in 1872 as part of a play, the popularity of “Bože Pravde” helped to have it officially adopted as the Serbian anthem in 1904, after Serbia became an independent nation in the 1880s. Upon forming the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later to be called Yugoslavia) in 1918, “Bože Pravde” was retained as the anthem of the Serbs within the federation. In fact, the first anthem of the federation, in use until 1945, uses part of “Bože Pravde” in the melody to represent the Serbs of the land.

After World War II, “Bože Pravde” continued to be popular with Serbs, and identified as their anthem. During the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s, Serbian areas that broke away from Croatia (Krajina) and Bosnia (Srpska) also used “Bože Pravde” upon their creation to identify themselves as a Serbian state. In August, 2004, 18 months after Yugoslavia became the new federation of Serbia and Montenegro, “Bože Pravde” was recommended as Serbia’s anthem by the Serb national assembly and was constitutionally adopted upon the dissolution of the union and the regaining of Serbian independence in 2006.  Although the anthem has four verses officially, it is usually only the first that is performed.

The original lyrics, present in the former Yugoslav anthem, refer to the Serbian monarchy, which was replaced with a republican-style government in 1945. The current lyrics of the Serbian anthem replace the references to the king with references to the Serbian race. The music of the anthem is by a Slovene, Davorin Jenko.

1. God of Justice; Thou who saved us
when in deepest bondage cast,
Hear Thy Serbian children’s voices,
Be our help as in the past.

With Thy mighty hand sustain us,
Still our rugged pathway trace;
God, our hope; protect and cherish
Serbian country and Serbian race!
God, our hope; protect and cherish
Serbian country and Serbian race!

2. Bind in closest links our kindred
Teach the love that will not fail,
May the loathed fiend of discord
Never in our ranks prevail.

Let the golden fruits of union
Our young tree of freedom grace;
God, our Master! guide and prosper
Serbian country and Serbian race.
God, our Master! guide and prosper
Serbian country and Serbian race.

3. Lord! Avert from us Thy vengeance,
Thunder of Thy dreaded ire;
Bless each Serbian town and hamlet,
Mountain, meadow, heart and spire.

When our host goes forth to battle
Death or victory to embrace-
God of armies! be our leader
Strengthen then the Serbian race.
God of armies! be our leader
Strengthen then the Serbian race.

4. On our sepulchre of ages
Breaks the resurrection morn,
From the slough of direst slavery
Serbia anew is born.

Through five hundred years of durance
We have knelt before Thy face,
All our kin, O God! deliver,
Thus entreats the Serbian race. 
All our kin, O God! deliver,
Thus entreats the Serbian race.

		<string>Russian flag is composed of three horizontal stripes of equal width. Red, blue and white are considered traditional Pan-Slavic colors and wide number of states adopted them in the 19th century since Russia was at that time the only independent Slavic state. During the rule of the Communist Party, the tricolor was replaced by the red flag with a hammer and a sickle in the upper left part of the flag. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kremlin decided to return to traditional tricolor. There are many theories explaining the symbolism of the tricolor. White can represent the aristocracy, Belarusians, God, peace, purity, or honesty; blue Ukrainians, tsar, persistence, or faith and fortitude; red can stand for Russians, people, power, or blood shed for the country.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In late 2000, Russia’s new president Vladimir Putin, made creation of a new anthem for Russia a top priority, since a common complaint was not having words to their current anthem. In early December 2000, Putin presented a bill in the national asssembly to have the melody of the old anthem from the Soviet Union adopted as the new national anthem.  The measure passed by a wide margin on December 8, but it was not without controversy, both at the time and since.  Many (including former President Yeltsin) did not feel a change was necessary, and the use of the old Soviet anthem could be seen as rejecting post-Communist reforms.  Others have expressed concerns that the melody brings back memories of the past of hardships under the Communist regime, especially the crimes that took place under Stalin (who was Soviet leader when the anthem was first introduced).

It was then needed to adopt lyrics for the anthem, as the Communist-era lyrics would be inappropriate.  After reviewing thousands of entries, new lyrics by Sergei Vladimirovich Mikhalkov (the same person who wrote the lyrics to the old Soviet anthem) were adopted.  The lyrics were also not without controversy as well, the main one being that the words were not well-known (perhaps due to the fact that this was the third set of words used for the melody since its introduction in 1944).  Others, particularly the Communist deputies in the legislature, who were in favour of adopting Alexandrov’s melody, objected to the reference to God in the anthem.

Special thanks to: Pavel Zinovatny for some of this information, and the English translation of the lyrics.

		<string>The flag of Rwanda is composed of three unequal horizontal stripes in blue, yellow and green colors. In the upper right corner of the flag, untraditionally positioned yellow sun is placed. The flag has been adopted in 2002 as a reminder of the genocide that took place in the last century and during which more than million members of tribe Tutsi was brutally murdered. The blue color on the flag designed by Rwandan artist Alphons Kirimobenecy represents peace, yellow color symbolizes hope for better tomorrows and the green color expresses prosperity of the country and its natural resources. The previous flag was originally identical with the flag of Guinea, thus Rwanda had been forced to add a capital letter R on its flag.</string>

		<string>On December 31, 2001, Rwanda altered the national symbols, as a break from their violent and bloody past. The new national anthem is very reminiscent of African-style music, like others in the “Eastern folk” style of anthem.

		<string>The flag of Saudi Arabia consists of a green background where an inscription in Arabic "There is no god but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet" and a sword pointing to the left side of the flag are located. When the flag is raised, two flags have to be sewn together, so that the inscription is readable from both sides and that the sword is always pointing in the desired direction. The sword should commemorate the unification of the Kingdom in the 12th century, which took place under the leadership of Ibn Saud. The green color is traditionally associated with Islam, but primarily it is the color of Wanhabs and Sunnis. It is interesting that it is forbidden to lower the flag to half-mast under the threat of criminal prosecution for insulation of Islam.</string>

		<string>In 1947, Saudi Arabia lacked an anthem, so, when King Abdulaziz visited Egypt that year, he asked Egyptian composer Abdul Rahman Al-Khateeb to create an anthem and “Aash Al Maleek” was created.  The melody, an Arab fanfare style, is similar to those of other Arab states in the area at the time.  In 1958, the first set of lyrics were written for the anthem by Mohammed Talat, Ragozat, Die Nationalhynmen der Welt (1982) per meltzer-but weren’t often heard.ragozat end  In 1984 King Fahd ask poet Ibrahim Al Khafaji to write new lyrics, which are the official lyrics today.</string>

		<string>The flag of Sudan, which has been adopted in 1970, consists of three horizontal stripes in red, white and black colors and a green wedge in the left part of the flag. The flag from the days before the coup in 1970 consisted of a horizontal blue-yellow-green tricolor. The current flag is very similar to the former flag of Libya, which also bears traditional pan-Arab colors to commemorate solidarity towards the other Arab nations. Official symbolism of colors is as follows: red stripe represents struggles and blood shed, white stands for Islamic people, peace and love, black represents Sudan itself, and green symbolizes prosperity and agricultural tradition of Sudan.</string>

		<string>The Swedish flag was most likely inspired by the oldest Nordic flag - Danish Danneborg. Yellow cross on a blue background reaches the edges of the flag and its shorter arm is located closer to the left side of the flag. The characteristic yellow and blue color have probably originated in the 14th century, when the Swedish coat of arms with three gold crowns on a blue background was created. The flag has been used since 1521 and it became very popular during the reign of Gustav I Vasa. At that time, the yellow cross had to be compulsorily pictured on every cocard and battalion. However, the flag in its present form has not been adopted until 1906.</string>

		<string>Sweden’s anthem was written in 1844. The author of the lyrics chose a Swedish folk tune from the province of Västmanland to set his words to to create the anthem and entitled it “Sång till Norden” (Song of the North). nenzelius startThe song was created at a time when a “pan-Scandinavian” movement was strong, which is why it is a “Song to the North” instead of just to Sweden. nenzelius end  This has led to other verses being written that are more patriotic to Sweden, but these additional verses have never gained popularity and have never been considered part of the national anthem.

stolt startIn the late 19th century the anthem started to be considered as Sweden’s “national anthem”, differentiating it from the royal anthem that was being used as both a royal and national anthem.stolt end The anthem has never been officially legislated as Sweden’s national anthem, one attempt in the 1930s by a member of parliament brought forth claims by the opposition of wanting state controlled patriotism. stolt start(However, a bill in 1960 which attempted to make a different song the national anthem was defeated, which indirectly gave official support to “Sång till Norden”.)stolt end

		<string>The flag of Singapore, which has been adopted together with the national emblem and anthem in 1959, is composed of red and white horizontal stripes. On the left side of the upper red stripe, symbols of a white crescent and five five-pointed stars representing democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality are placed. Moreover, crescent and stars are traditional symbols of Islam and it was placed on the flag to commemorate Malay Muslim minority living in the country. According to the official interpretation, the flag reflects an emergence of a new nation, the red color stands for equality and white for purity and chastity. Before 1959, the flag of Great Britain was used instead of the national flag.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The National Anthem was written in the wake of nationalism during 1956-57. Its composer and author, Zubir Said, had written it on the basis of two words, “Majulah Singapura” or “Onward Singapore”, as a theme for the city council’s official functions.  It was first performed in 1958 at the Victoria Theatre. After Singapore attained self government, the song was slightly re-written and was re-introduced in 1959, at the installation of the new head of state and the introduction of the state (later national) flag. The anthem was used as a state song within Malaysia, of which it was a part, and was adopted as a national anthem in 1965 upon independence.

In 2000, the anthem underwent a slight change in that the official arrangement was made more solemn and inspiring. The new version, arranged by Phoon Yew Tien, was officially recorded at the Victoria Concert Hall in November of that year (where the first performance took place 42 years earlier) and was officially unveiled in January, 2001.

Although Singapore has four official languages (Malay, English, Mandarin Chinese, and Tamil), the anthem is only to be sung in the original Malay lyrics, not any translation, tjut startas Malay is indigenous to the region and is designated the National Languagetjut end. (As such, the English translation is presented here, as on several other pages on this site, as a guide for reader comprehension only.)

		<string>The Slovenian flag consists of three horizontal stripes in Pan-Slavic colors (white, blue, and red). On the left side of the flag on the border between the white and the red stripe, the Slovenian coat of arms depicting the highest peak Triglav covered with snow is placed together with three six-pointed stars taken from the armor of the family Celje who had a great influence in the 14th and 15th century. Two wavy lines at the bottom of the emblem represent the Slovenian lakes and rivers. The flag was adopted after the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, but the crest has not been added until 1993. Originally, the flag bore a "Yugoslav" star from the federal flag. The tricolor was adopted following the example of Russia as an expression of independence of Slavic nations.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>“Zdravljica” was written by France Prešeren, considered as Slovenia’s national poet, as a drinking song (in his original manuscript, the layout of the words resemble a wine glass), but also was seen as politically charged piece when it was written in 1844 as it spoke of pan-Slavic nationalism, which was controversial in Austria-Hungary (which Slovenia was part of at the time).  It was finally published in 1848, after revolutions in Austria-Hungary lifted the censorship.

In 1905, Zdravljica was set to music for the first time, the entire poem had a choral composition composed for it by Stanko Premrl, and this was the composition chosen as the Slovenian anthem in September 1989.  The constitution of Slovenia, adopted on December 23, 1991, does not specify a specific verse and just states that “Zdravljica” is the national anthem.  The 1994 act regulating the flag, anthem, and other symbols states that is is just the seventh verse that is the anthem, and in government publications and in practice, only the seventh verse (as also presented here) is the anthem.</string>

		<string>The Slovak flag is composed of Pan-Slavic tricolor of white, blue and red color. From 1918 to 1993, there was a common state of Czechs and Slovaks, so the current Slovak flag has not been adopted until the disintegration of Czechoslovakia. Double cross erected on three hills, which is located closer to the side left side of the flag, indicates the beginnings of Christianity in the area of Carpathians. The emblem has been a symbol of Slovaks for a long time, but the tricolor has not been adopted until 1848 when many Slavic nations took inspiration from Russia as the only independent Slavic during the fights for independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Until the breakup of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the Slovak anthem was used as part of the Czechoslovak anthem. The melody of the anthem, long used as an unofficial anthem, is that of a Slovak folk song entitled “Kopala studienku”. The lyrics were written by a Slovak student who was one of those who joined other students in an exodus from Bratislava to Levoča in 1843 in protest over the firing of a teacher who had Slovak nationalist views; the Tatras, mentioned in the first verse, are a mountain range the students would have passed through on their way from Bratislava to eastern Slovakia, and have been used as a symbol of the nation as a whole.

The song quickly became popular with Slovaks, especially the other students involved in the protest and was used as the Slovak anthem when Czechoslovakia was created.  Upon restoration of Slovak independence in 1993, the anthem was made the anthem of Slovakia, slightly altering the version in use until then by replacing the phrase “Zastavme sa” (“Let us pause”), which was a common variant to that point, with “Zastavme ich” (“Let us stop them”), which was determined to be the original words in Matúška’s poem.</string>

The flag consists of three horizontal stripes - a green one is located on the top, white one in the middle and blue one at the bottom. Green symbolizes the lush vegetation, mountains and agricultural tradition of the country, whereas the white color stands for peace and unity. The blue stripe reminds Atlantic Ocean, which washes the shores of Sierra Leone. This color combination was probably inspired by the national coat of arms. Sierra Leone has a relatively mountainous profile, especially in the northeastern part of the country, that is why the literal translation of the country´s name means "lion mountains".</string>

The tricolor is also derived from the French tricolor as Senegal was a French colony until 1960. Green star symbolizes openness to the other five continents.

1. Pincez tous vos Koras,frappez les balafons.
Le lion a rugi.
Le dompteur de la brousse
D’un bond s’est élancé
Dissipant les ténèbres.
Soleil sur nos terreurs,soleil sur notre espoir.
Debout, frères, voici l’Afrique rassemblée

CHORUS:
Fibres de mon coeur vert.
Épaule contre épaule, mes plus que frères,
O Sénégalais, debout!
Unissons la mer et les sources,unissons la steppe et la forêt!
Salut Afrique mère, salut Afrique mère.

2. Sénégal toi le fils de l’écume du Lion, 
Toi surgi de la nuit au galop des chevaux, 
Rend-nous, oh! rends-nous l’honneur de nos Ancêstres, 
Splendides comme ébène et forts comme le muscle 
Nous disons droits-l’épée n’a pas une bavure. 

Chorus

3. Sénégal, nous faisons nôtre ton grand dessein:
Rassembler les poussins à l’abri des milans
Pour en faire, de l’Est à l’Ouest, du Nord au Sud,
Dressé, un même peuple, un peuple sans couture
Mais un peuple tourné vers tous les vents du monde.

Chorus

4. Sénégal, comme toi, comme tous nos héros,
Nous serons durs sans haine et des deux bras ouverts.
L’épée, nous la mettrons dans la paix du fourreau,
Car le travail sera notre arme et la parole.
Le Bantou est un frère, et l’Arabe et le Blanc.

Chorus

5. Mais que si l’ennemi incendie nos frontières
Nous serons tous dressés et les armes au poing:
Un Peuple dans sa foi défiant tous les malheurs,
Les jeunes et les vieux, les hommes et les femmes.
La Mort, oui! Nous disons la Mort, mais pas la honte.

1. Sound, all of you, your Koras, 
Beat the drums, 
The red Lion has roared,
The Tamer of the bush with one leap has rushed forward
Scattering the gloom.
Light on our terrors,
Light on our hopes.
Arise, brothers, Africa behold united!

CHORUS:
Shoulder to shoulder,
O people of Senegal, more than brothers to me, arise!
Unite the sea and the springs,
Unite the steppe and the forest!
Hail, mother Africa,
Hail, mother Africa! 

2. Senegal, thou son of the Lion
Arise in the night with great speed,
Restore, oh, restore to us the honour of our ancestors,
Magnificent as ebony and strong as muscles!
We are a straight people-the sword has no fault.

Chorus

3. Senegal, we make your great design our own:
To gather the chicks, sheltering them from kites,
To make from them, from East to West, from North to South,
A people rising as one, in seamless unity,
Yet a people facing all the winds of the earth.

Chorus

4. Senegal, like thee, like all our heroes,
We will be stern without hatred, and with open arms.
The sword we will put peacefully in its sheath,
For work and words will be our weapon.
The Bantu is our brother, the Arab, and the White man too.

Chorus

5. But if the enemy violates our frontiers,
We will all be ready, weapons in our hands;
A people in its faith defying all evil;
Young and old, men and women,
Death, yes! but not dishonour.  

Chorus

		<string>The flag of Somalia, which has been adopted by southern Somalia in 1954, consists of a light blue sheet with a white five-pointed star in its center. The blue color refers to the United Nations, which managed part of Somalia for many years. Each tip of the star represents one of the areas where Somalis live today. These areas are: Northern and southern Somalia, northern Kenya, southern Ethiopia and Djibouti. The flag has been adopted in the period of the Italian governance and its layout is reminiscent of the Vietnamese flag. The white color of the star also indicates peace and prosperity, and its symbolism is of great importance for Somalia as a country ravaged by a series of wars and coups.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Somalia’s flag was first flown in 1954, 6 years before Somali independence, as a symbol of the Somali people.  The song “Qolobaa Calankeed” was written the following year to celebrate the adoption of a flag for the Somali people.  After a long period of governmental instability, the song was proclaimed as the new Somali anthem in the August 1, 2012 constitution as a break from the past.</string>

		<string>The flag of Suriname, which has been adopted in 1975, consists of five horizontal stripes from the top in green, white, red, white and green colors. In the red field, a yellow five-pointed star is placed. Suriname has been under the British and Dutch dominion and it did not gain independence from the Dutch until 1975. Suriname is due to high level of emigration and immigration very multicultural country and the yellow star stands for the unity of all these groups. Green color on the flag represents fertility of the landscape, opportunities and hope for new and better Surinam, white color symbolizes justice and freedom and the red color should symbolize love.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem has its beginnings in a Sunday School song written in 1893 by Cornelis Atses Hoekstra called “Suriname’s Trotsche Stroomen” (Suriname’s Proud Streams).  The song was set to a piece of music by Johannes Corstianus de Puy written in 1876.  In 1959, after self-government was granted, the government asked the poet Henry de Ziel (whose pen name was Trefossa) to write lyrics for the anthem in the language popularly spoken in Suriname, Sranan Tongo.  He also revised Hoekstra’s lyrics of the second verse to remove the “negative tones” in some lines.  Originally the anthem was song with de Ziel’s verse first, but now it is perfomed with Hoekstra’s Dutch verse first and de Ziel’s Sranan lyrics as the second verse.

		<string>In preparation for the upcoming independence referendum in January, 2011, the South Sudan National Anthem Committee asked a group of 49 writers to come up with an anthem for the country.  After being guidelines by the army and government, which stated that the anthem had to include mentions of its history, people, and resources, as well as being told about the struggle for independence, lyrics were then chosen by means of a televised competition.  Originally under the working title “Land of Cush” (in reference to a Biblical kingdom which is roughly located in the area of South Sudan), the lyrics were revised several times in the following months after the successful independence referendum, and a final version was settled in March, 2011, which slightly altered the wording (among other things replacing the word “Cush” with “South Sudan”).

Saluting our martyrs whose blood
Cemented our national foundation
We vow to protect our nation

		<string>The islands São Tomé and Príncipe are located in the Gulf of Guinea and its flag has been adopted in 1975. It consists of three horizontal stripes - two green on the top and at the bottom and a yellow one in the middle. In the left part of the flag a red wedge is placed. Moreover, the yellow stripe bears in its center two black stars that represent both islands. The selected colors have traditional Pan-African interpretation - black  color represents the African people, green vegetation of the islands, yellow stands for the sun and red is to commemorate the efforts spent on achieving independence. The islands were under Portuguese rule until 1975 and the current flag has been inspired by the flag of the movement for independence.</string>

		<string>The flag of El Salvador is composed of three horizontal stripes where the outer ones are dark blue and the middle one is white. These colors are typical of the states of the former United Provinces of Central America, a member of which Salvador was along with Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Two blue stripes denote the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean surrounding Salvador and the white stripe symbolizes peace. In the middle of the white stripe, a coat of arms of El Salvador, which depicts a triangle referring to the three pillars of the Republic - the executive, legislative and judicial powers, is placed. Furthermore, there are five volcanoes and a red cap, which is commemorating the abolition of slavery. Five blue flags represent the five former members of the fourteen provinces and the parts of the laurel wreath stands for individual states.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>One of the longest national anthems in existence (that is, in the style that it’s usually performed, with the musical introduction, the chorus, the first verse, and the chorus again), the Salvadoran anthem is a typical example of a “Latin American epic anthem”. It was commonly adopted as the National Song on September 15, 1879 but did not have official recognition until December 11, 1953.

The anthem was composed by an Italian composer that arrived in the country at the end of the 18th Century as the Director of an opera company and written by General Juan José Cañas, a poet and distinguished military officer, around the year 1856. It was composed at the recommendation of the president Dr. Rafael Zaldívar and was sung for the first time on September 15, 1879 at the National Palace by children and young students from government and private schools of the capital city, and the anthem was very well recieved after the initial performance.

1. De la paz en la dicha suprema

por llenar su grandioso destino: 
conquistarse un feliz porvenir.

rechazar el odioso poder.   
Dolorosa y sangrienta es su historia, 
pero excelsa y brillante a la vez; 
manantial de legítima gloria, 
gran lección de espartana altivez.   
No desmaya en su innata bravura, 
en cada hombre hay un héroe inmortal 
que sabrá mantenerse a la altura 
de su antiguo valor proverbial.   
valor proverbial, valor proverbial.   

Chorus

3. Todos son abnegados, y fieles 
al prestigio del bélico ardor 
con que siempre segaron laureles 
de la patria salvando el honor.   
Respetar los derechos extraños 
y apoyarse en la recta razón 
es para ella, sin torpes amaños 
su invariable, más firme ambición.   
Y en seguir esta línea se aferra 
dedicando su esfuerzo tenaz, 
en hacer cruda guerra a la guerra; 
su ventura se encuentra en la paz. 
encuentra en la paz, encuentra en la paz.

1. Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness,
El Salvador has always nobly dreamed.
To achieve this has been her eternal proposition,
To keep it, her greatest glory.
With inviolable faith, she eagerly follows
The way of progress
In order to fulfil her high destiny
And achieve a happy future.
A stern barrier protects her
Against the clash of vile disloyalty,
Ever since the day when her lofty banner,
In letters of blood, wrote “Freedom”,
Wrote “Freedom”, wrote “Freedom”.

Chorus

2. Freedom is her dogma and her guide;
A thousand times she has defended it,
And as many times has she repelled
The hateful power of atrocious tyranny.
Her history has been bloody and sad,
Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant,
A source of legitimate glory
And a great lesson in Spartan pride.
Her innate bravery shall not waver:
In every man there is an immortal hero
Who knows how to maintain the level
Of the proverbial valour of old.
Valour of old, valour of old.

Chorus

3. All are self-denying and faithful
To the tradition of warlike ardour
With which they have always reaped fame
By saving the motherland’s honour.
To respect the rights of others
And base her actions on right and justice
Is for her, without infamous intrigue,
The constant and most firm ambition.
And in following this line she persists,
Dedicating her tenacious efforts
In giving hard battle for battle; 
Her happiness is found in peace, 
Is found in peace, is found in peace.

		<string>The Syrian flag consists of tricolor of horizontal stripes of red, white, and black color. Furthermore, there are two green five-pointed stars in the middle of the white stripe. The tricolor was adopted during the struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. However, independence did not last long and Syria became dominated by French and it has not achieved independence until the end of the 2nd World War in 1946. Since that time, the flag has changed several times, but the pan-Arab colors remained. The current flag was adopted in 1980 for the second time - for the first time it was in 1958, when Syria formed the United Arab Republic together with Egypt. An interesting fact is that after a change of political situation in the alliance, the stars were replaced by symbol of hawk for a short time, which currently is a dominant of the Egyptian flag.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The national anthem of Syria was adopted in 1936; the composers of the music also composed many other Arab folk songs of the Middle East region.  During the time that Syria was a member of the United Arab Republic (1958-1961), the UAR anthem was in use, which consisted of the then-Egyptian anthem followed by “Ħumāt ad-Diyār”. Once Syria left the union, the anthem was again performed on its own.

1. Defenders of the realm,
Peace on you;
Our proud spirits will
Not be subdued.
The abode of Arabism,
A hallowed sanctuary;
The seat of the stars,
An inviolable preserve.

2. Syria’s plains are
Towers in the heights,
Resembling the sky
Above the clouds.
A land resplendant
With brilliant suns,
Becoming another sky,
Or almost a sky.

		<string>The background of the flag of Swaziland, which has been adopted in 1968, consists of five horizontal stripes. The very top and the bottom one are blue, followed by two narrower yellow stripes and wider red stripe in the middle. In the center of the red stripe, a white-black Masai shield with two spears and a stick behind is placed. Both ends of the stick as well as the shield itself are decorated with purple-blue feathers from modes cock and Turacos. The shield and arms meant to symbolize readiness of Swaziland people to fight for their territory. Tufts of feathers represent Swaziland royal dynasty. Dark red stripe represents past bloodsheds and black and white on the shield reminds racial tolerance in the country.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The national anthem, adopted in 1968 on independence, was composed after extensive ethno-musicological fieldwork in Swaziland. The national anthem was a compromise between Swazi and western styles of music. Swazi music stresses on songs with inticrate polyphony, which is evident in the anthem, making this anthem one of the best examples of the “Eastern folk” style of anthem.</string>

		<string>The flag of Chad consists of a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow and red stripes. The flag is almost identical to the flag of Romania, but its blue stripe has a darker shade. The flag has been inspired by the French tricolor as Chad was for many years a French colony. At the same time, it carries two Pan-African colors and therefore refers to ties both to France and the other African countries. The blue stripe on the left side of the flag represents the African sky and waterways, yellow stripe symbolizes the sun and dry desert in northern part of Chad and red traditionally stands for courage and the bloodshed during the struggles for independence. The flag has been adopted in 1959, when Chad was freed from the French rule.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>“La Tchadienne” was composed for the proclamation of independence in 1960.

		<string>The flag of Togo was designed by Aheyi Paul and it has been adopted in 1960. It consists of five horizontal stripes altering between green and orange-yellow color. In the pole part of the flag, a red square that bears symbol of white five-pointed star is placed. The colors used are of classic pan-African symbolism, therefore, it stands for solidarity among all the independent African nations. The flag´s design is very similar to Liberian flag. Five lanes allegedly represent the five regions of the country - the coast, the plateau, the central region, Kara region and savannas. Another interpretation says that the five bars indicate five fingers, which should symbolize human behavior.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Originally adopted on independence in 1960, the national anthem was replaced in 1979 and restored in 1991, when Western-mandated reforms were brought in and one-party rule dropped.

		<string>The current flag of Thailand is known as trairanga, which means tricolor. Also, Thailand is sometimes called "the country of a white elephant" since the original flag carried in its center a symbol of elephant. However, the elephant has been in 1917, when the country entered the war, replaced by a blue stripe. Since then, the flag bears a red-white-blue tricolor which should have referred to solidarity with allies in the First World War, especially with France. The flag has not been changed since that time, it has stayed the same even after renaming the country from Siam to Thailand in 1939. The interpretation of colors on the flag is as follows: blue represents the monarchy, the white purity of the nation and Buddhism and the red stands for blood shed by the local population while fighting for freedom.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The current Thai anthem is actually the latest of many used in the history of the country, although few have enjoyed the longevity the current anthem has.

The notion of a Thai (or Siamese, as Thailand was then known as Siam) anthem was first raised in 1871, when the king, upon visiting the British colony of Singapore, noticed that the British had a national anthem, so one should be made for his country. The first anthem, written by Phraya Sri Sunthornvoharn and entitled “Jom Raj Jong Charoen” (Long Live the King), was derived from an anthem written by two British officers who trained the military band. This anthem proved unpopular, and the second, “Bulan Loy Luen” (Moving Moon), was composed and written by King Rama II.

The third anthem, “Phleng Sansasoen Phra Barami” (A Salute to the Monarch) is still in use today as the royal anthem, but it ceased being the national anthem after the 1932 coup. A short lived song, “Chart Mahachai” was the national anthem for a while, but the coup planners wanted to have the composer Peter Feit (known in Thailand as Phra Jenduriyang) compse an anthem for the citizenry in the spirit of “La Marseillaise”. With lyrics by Khun Wichitmatra the new anthem was played for the first time in July, 1932, and the lyrics were subsequently rewritten two years later by Chan Kamwilai. When the nation’s name was changed to Thailand from Siam in 1939, it was decided new lyrics should be written, and the lyrics by Luang Saranuprapan won the contest and remain the lyrics today. It was also ordered around this time that the anthem must be played every day at 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. when the national flag is also to be raised and lowered. The citizens must stand and show respect for the nation when the anthem is heard. This law remains in force today.

Every inch of Thailand belongs to the Thais.
It has long maintained its sovereignty,
Because the Thais have always been united.
The Thai people are peace-loving,
But they are no cowards at war.
They shall allow no one to rob them of their independence,
Nor shall they suffer tyranny.
All Thais are ready to give up every drop of blood
For the nation’s safety, freedom and progress. Hurrah!

		<string>The flag of Tajikistan consists of three horizontal stripes in red, white and green colors. Furthermore, in the middle of the white stripe, there is an emblem displaying a gold crown with seven stars above. The colors of the flag are inspired by the Tajik pledge from the days of dominance of the Soviet Union. The red color serves as a reminder of the communist past of the country, the white stripe stands for cotton production and green stripe refers to advanced agricultural production of Tajikistan. The gold stars represent friendship toward the other nations and the crown symbolizes the country's sovereignty. Tajikistan has not adopted a national flag until 1992 - quite late after the collapse of the USSR compared to the other newly formed states.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem of Tajikistan, a Central Asian nation, was officially adopted three years after 1991 independence when new words were given to the old music used when Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union.

		<string>On May 20, 2002, this former part of Indonesia also known as East Timor regained the independence it had briefly until Indonesia took over the island following Portuguese withdrawal from the territory in 1975. It was a logical choice for the new nation to adopt, as the anthem was first played upon its original declaration of independence. It remained the national anthem until the country was invaded by and incorporated into Indonesia a few days later (the Indonesian anthem was then officially used in the territory). The author of the lyrics, poet Francisco Borja da Costa, was killed in the Indonesian invasion.

The official lyrics are in Portuguese, however they have been translated into Tetum, the other official language that is native to the country.  However, these lyrics seem to be just a translation and don’t appear to fit the music.</string>

		<string>The flag of Turkmenistan is considered one of the most complicated flags. The base consists of dark green leaf with five white five-pointed stars and motif of a white crescent in the upper middle section. The left part of the flag contains a vertical stripe with the motif of so-called Gulus - patterns used while manufacturing carpets. Turkmenistan is renowned producer of carpets that is why this pattern was used.  Under the Gulus, crossed olive branches, which stands for peace of the United Nations, are placed. Five Gulus and five stars represent the five major Turkmen tribes and five provinces of the country. At the same time, the stars along with the crescent and the green color are traditional symbols of Islam.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>After the passing of its first President, the Turkmen anthem had to be re-written to remove references to him in the anthem lyrics. The new lyrics substitutes “the people” instead and the lyrics remain relatively the same. Also, the music has been slightly changed by switching the order of the verse and chorus, in the new version the verse precedes the chorus.

		<string>The flag of Tunisia was adopted in 1835 and it has not changed much since then. Red leaf bears the traditional symbols of Islam - red crescent and five-pointed star in a white circle, which is meant to symbolize the sun. These symbols also point to the historical ties to the Ottoman Empire. The flag may resemble a flag of Turkey as Tunisia was for several centuries dominated by Turkish, though the moon and stars have a white color in case of Turkish flag. Also, there is no white circle. The flag in this form (with slight modifications), exists from the 19th century approximately, so it endured the period of French domination up to gaining the independence in 1956.</string>

		<string>The lyrics of the Tunisian anthem were written by an Egyptian in the 1930s. Originally just one verse, another two were added by the Tunisian national poet Aboul-Qacem Echebbi. The music was composed by the same person who wrote the music of the anthems of Libya and the United Arab Emirates. It was first used as an interim anthem after the deposition of the monarchy, between the times when the Bey’s anthem was abolished and the first anthem under the republic was instituted.  It was then introduced again in 1987 since the previous anthem was closely tied to the government of Habib Bourguiba, who had been deposed.</string>

Let thunderbolts rain with fire.

Arms like granite towers.

Offer peace to friends.

Destiny must surely respond.
Oppression shall then vanish.
Fetters are certain to break.

		<string>The flag of a Pacific state Tonga is one of the older flags, it dates from 1863. For its excessive resemblance to the flag of the Red Cross, it has been slightly modified in 1863. The current flag is composed of a red leaf and white rectangle in the upper left corner. In the white rectangle, a red isosceles rectangular cross is placed. The cross is supposed to symbolize the Christian faith of Tonga´s inhabitants and red color stands for the Jesus Christ´s blood. Until 1970, Tonga was under British rule, and then the archipelago has become a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Currently, Tonga benefits mainly from development of tourism and cooperation within the Commonwealth.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The anthem was first performed in 1874, though it probably was in use earlier.  Officially it is named “Ko e fasi ʻo e tuʻi ʻo e ʻOtu Tonga”, but it is more popularly known as “Fasi Fakafonua”.  The anthem references King Tupou; while this was the name of the king of Tonga when the anthem was written, it is also the name of the Tongan Royal House, and therefore of every Tongan ruler since 1874.

		<string>Turkish flag consists of a red leaf with a symbol of white crescent and a five-pointed star that are located in the left part of the flag. The symbolism of all these elements has its roots in ancient history. The red color was used by the Ottoman Empire, whose origins date back to the 13th century. Crescent and star are ancient symbols of Islam, however it appeared in Turkey even before Islam. Crescent has been on the flag since the 16th century and it is a symbol of the goddess Diana, guardian of the city Byzancion. The star, originally eight-pointed, has been on the flag since 1793 and is associated with the Virgin Mary, whom Constantinople (later Istanbul) was consecrated. Allegedly, these symbols were chosen by Sultan Murad II., when he saw the moon and stars in a puddle of blood during the Battle of Kosovo in 1448.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>The “İstiklâl Marşı” was officially adopted as Turkey’s national anthem on March 12, 1921. 724 poems were submitted to a competition organized to find and select the most suitable original composition, and a poem written by the poet Mehmet Akif Ersoy was adopted unanimously by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. There are ten verses to Ersoy’s poem, but only the first two are usually sung as the national anthem.

Twenty-four composers participated in another competition arranged for the selection of a musical composition for the National Anthem. The Council, which was only able to convene in 1924 due to the War of Independence, adopted the music composed by Ali Rifat Çagatay. The words of the National Anthem were sung to this music for six years. The music of the National Anthem was then changed to an arrangement written by Zeki Üngör, conductor of the Presidental Symphonic Orchestra, and the words of the National Anthem have been sung to this musical accompaniment ever since.

The anthem of Turkey is also used in the Turkish areas of northern Cyprus.</string>

1. Korkma! Sönmez bu şafaklarda yüzen al sancak;
Sönmeden yurdumun üstünde tüten en son ocak.
O benim milletimin yıldızıdır, parlayacak!
O benimdir, o benim milletimindir ancak!
 
2. Çatma kurban olayım, çehreni ey nazlı hilâl;
Kahraman ırkıma bir gül… Ne bu şiddet, bu celâl?
Sana olmaz dökülen kanlarımız sonra helâl;
Hakkıdır Hakk’a tapan, milletimin istiklâl.
 
3. Ben ezelden beridir hür yaşadım, hür yaşarım.
Hangi çılgın bana zincir vuracakmış? Şaşarım!
Kükremiş sel gibiyim: Bendimi çiğner, aşarım.
Yırtarım dağları, enginlere sığmam, taşarım.
 
4. Garb’ın âfâkını sarmışsa çelik zırhlı duvar;
Benim imân dolu göğsüm gibi serhaddim var.
Ulusun, korkma! Nasıl böyle bir îmanı boğar,
“Medeniyyet!” dediğin tek dişi kalmış canavar?
 
5. Arkadaş! Yurduma alçakları uğratma sakın;
Siper et gövdeni, dursun bu hayâsızca akın.
Doğacaktır sana va’dettiği günler Hakk’ın,
Kim bilir, belki yarın, belki yarından da yakın.
 
6. Bastığın yerleri “toprak!” diyerek geçme, tanı!
Düşün altındaki binlerce kefensiz yatanı.
Sen şehîd oğlusun, incitme, yazıktır atanı:
Verme, dünyaları alsan da, bu cennet vatanı.
 
7. Kim bu cennet vatanın uğruna olmaz ki fedâ?
Şühedâ fışkıracak toprağı sıksan, şühedâ!
Cânı, cânânı, bütün varımı alsın da Hudâ,
Etmesin tek vatanımdan beni dünyâda cüdâ.
 
8. Rûhumun senden ilâhî şudur ancak emeli:
Değmesin ma’bedimin göğsüne nâ-mahrem eli!
Bu ezanlar – ki sehâdetleri dînin temeli –
Ebedî, yurdumun üstünde benim inlemeli.
 
9. O zaman vecd ile bin secde eder – varsa – taşım;
Her cerîhamdan, İlâhi, boşanır kanlı yaşım;
Fışkırır rûh-i mücerred gibi yerden na’şım!
O zaman yükselerek Arş’a değer, belki, başım!
 
10. Dalgalan sen de şafaklar gibi ey şanlı hilâl!
Olsun artık dökülen kanlarım hepsi helâl.
Ebediyyen sana yok, ırkıma yok izmihlâl:
Hakkıdır, hür yaşamış, bayrağımın hürriyet;
Hakkıdır, Hakk’a tapan, milletimin istiklâl.

1. Fear not! For the crimson flag that proudly waves in these dawns, shall never fade,
Before the last fiery hearth that is ablaze within my nation burns out.
And that, is the star of my nation, and it will forever shine;
It is mine; and solely belongs to my nation.
 
2. Frown not, I beseech you, oh thou coy crescent,
But smile upon my heroic nation! Why the anger, why the rage?
The blood we shed for you will not be worthy otherwise;
For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation.
 
3. I have been free since the beginning and forever will be so.
What madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea!
I’m like the roaring flood; powerful and independent,
I’ll tear apart mountains, exceed all that is known to Man, and still gush out!
 
4. The lands of the West may be armored with walls of steel,
But I have borders guarded by the mighty chest of a believer.
Recognize your innate strength! And think: how can this fiery faith ever be killed,
By that battered, single-toothed monster you call “civilization”?
 
5. My friend! Leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men!
Render your chest as armor! Stop this disgraceful rush!
For soon shall be come the day of promised freedom…
Who knows? Perhaps tomorrow? Perhaps even sooner!
 
6. See not the soil you tread on as mere earth,
But think about the thousands beneath you that lie without even shrouds.
You’re the noble son of a martyr, take shame, hurt not your ancestor!
Unhand not, even when you’re promised worlds, this paradise of a homeland.
 
7. What man would not die for this heavenly piece of land?
Martyrs would gush out if you just squeeze the soil! Martyrs!
May God take all my loved ones and possessions from me if he will,
But may he not deprive me of my one true homeland for the world.
 
8. O Lord, the sole wish of my heart is that,
No infidel’s hand should touch the bosom of my temple.
These adhans, the shahadah of which is the base of the religion,
Shall sound loud over my eternal homeland.
 
9. Then my tombstone – if there is one – will a thousand times touch its forehead on earth in ecstasy,
O Lord, tears of blood flowing out of my every wound,
My corpse will gush out from the earth like a spirit,
And then, my head will perhaps rise and reach the heavens.
 
10. So flap and wave like the dawning sky, oh glorious crescent,
So that our every last drop of blood may finally be worthy!
Neither you nor my nation shall ever be extinguished!
For freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag;
For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation!

		<string>The flag of the island nation Trinidad and Tobago has been adopted after gaining independence in 1962 and its base consists of a red leaf. From the upper left corner, a diagonal black stripe flanked by narrower white stripes is led. This state was for a long time in the center of interest of colonial powers for its favorable geographic location. The Spaniards fought for it against the Dutch, the French and the British. The British transported to the islands many Indians in order to replace the African population slaving on plantations. As a consequence, Trinidad and Tobago is one of the most multicultural countries. The symbolism of the colors on the flag is as follows: black represents the unity of the local population, red stands for vitality and strength, and white is to commemorate the ripples on the sea surrounding the islands and the purity of ideals of the locals.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Patrick Castagne, a songwriter from Trinidad, had originally composed an anthem for the West Indies Federation (a proposed union of British-controlled islands in the West Indies, of which Trinidad was one of the largest in terms of area and population, and was also where the capital was located), however, this federation was dissolved in 1962 (partly due to Trinidad and Tobago striving for independence on its own).  He reworked the song, titled “A Song for Federation”, by slightly altering the text, and submitted it for the contest for the anthem of Trinidad and Tobago.  It was deemed to be the winner, and was played for the first time when independence was granted.

		<string>Tuvalu is an archipelago lying in Oceania between Australia and Hawaii. The flag consists of a pale blue sheet and a Union Jack flag in the upper left part of the flag. The blue color of the leaf represents the Pacific Ocean that surrounds the islands. Union Jack signals former ties to the UK, which Tuvalu got rid of in 1978. At that time it was known as the Ellice Islands. Another feature of the flag are nine yellow five-pointed stars, which represent nine inhabited islands that are part of Tuvalu. Unfortunately, Tuvalu is an area with a very low altitude, so is threatened by raising level of the world's oceans.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Also the national motto, the title of the national anthem “Tuvalu mo te Atua” also appears on the nation’s coat of arms. The lyrics reflect the deep Christian faith of the song’s author and the nation as a whole.  Tuvalu also has the British monarch as its head of state, and uses the British “God Save the Queen” as the royal anthem.</string>

Of Tuvalu we all share
In the knowledge that God
Ever rules in heav’n above,
And that we in this land
Are united in His love.

When we trust in God’s great law;
“Tuvalu for the Almighty”
Be our song for evermore!

2. Let us trust our lives henceforward
To the King to whom we pray,
With our eyes fixed firmly on Him
He is showing us the way.
“May we reign with Him in glory”
Be our song for evermore,
for His almighty power
Is our strength from shore to shore.
Shout aloud in jubilation
To the King Whom we adore.
“Tuvalu free and united”
Be our song for evermore!

		<string>The flag of Tanzania has been adopted in 1964 and it is composed of blue and green orthogonal triangles in the upper left and lower right corners. The triangles are separated by a black stripe, which is bordered by a narrower yellow stripe. The flag has been inspired by the flags of Tanganyika and Zanzibar - two states, which merged in order and created Tanzania. The green field is borrowed from the flag of Tanganyika and it refers to the agricultural tradition in this area and its lush vegetation. Blue reminds the Indian Ocean surrounding Zanzibar. Black color represents the original inhabitants of Tanzania and yellow symbolizes the country's mineral wealth.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Tanzania was the first African nation to use the popular African song “God Bless Africa” as its anthem, in 1961 when it was Tanganyika, and was retained after union with Zanzibar in 1964. It is now also used by South Africa (as part of the current anthem) and Zambia (with different words), and formerly used by Zimbabwe, Ciskei, and Transkei.  The version used in Tanzania is in Swahili (the official language of the country) and not in Sontonga’s original lyrics of Xhosa, and was translated by a group of people.

		<string>The flag of Ukraine consists of two horizontal stripes - light blue one on the top and bright yellow one at the bottom. The blue stripe represents the sky and the yellow one stands for Ukrainian fertile land and fields. Ukraine has undergone many territorial changes during its existence. It was doing very well in the 10th and 11th century as an independent Kievan Rus, however it was attached to Lithuania later. After gaining independence, it was eventually annexed again, this time to Russia and then to the Soviet Union. In 1991, Ukraine became independent and since 1992 it has started to use the flag in the present form again. Since that time, Ukraine has been facing a series of economic and political problems, so the national colors that also have religious significance are of great importance for Ukrainians.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>In 1862, Ukrainian poet and ethnographer Pavlo Chubynskyi wrote a poem “Ще не вмерла Україна” (“Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina”) [Ukraine Is Not Dead Yet] in 1862, which gained a wide popularity among the Ukrainian intelligentsia of the time.  It also caught the attention of Mykhailo Verbytskyi, a priest, and was moved to compose music for the poem; it was first performed as a choral work in 1864 in the Ukraine Theatre in Lvov.

Upon the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1917, a number of patriotic works were used in the capacity of a national anthem, including Chubynskyi’s work, but none of them were officially declared as the national anthem.  In 1920, Ukraine was made part of the Soviet Union, and “Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina” and other patriotic works were officially discouraged.  cahoon per fotw startDuring the second world war, the short lived Carpatho-Ukraine Republic (now located in western Ukraine) adopted “Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina” as its anthem.cahoon end  Upon the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine regained its independence and Chubynskyi’s anthem was the most popular choice already in use as an anthem; when independence was declared no lyrics were officially mandated, the lyrics that were in common use at the time differed somewhat from Chubynskyi’s original poem.

The lyrics were made official in 2003 and changed slightly; the most important change was made to the first line (and title), which were interestingly borrowed from the Polish anthem. In the new version, the case ending of the word “Ukraine” was changed, so that rather than saying “Ukraine hasn’t yet died, nor has her glory or freedom,” it now says that it’s Ukraine’s glory and freedom which haven’t perished. Also, the current version of the anthem is limited to the first verse of Chubynskyi’s poem (with the modification to the first line mentioned above) plus the chorus, which was the first half of Chubynskyi’s original chorus; previously, three verses and a chorus were commonly used.

		<string>The flag of Uganda was designed in 1962 by Ugandan minister of Justice Grace Ibingira. It consists of two times repeated tricolor of in total six horizontal stripes of black, yellow and red color - colors characteristic of the Ugandan People's Congress, which came to power in 1962. In the center of the flag, Crowned Crane in a white circle with a red comb is shown. The Crane is a national bird of Uganda and it appeared on the national coat of arms already by the time when Uganda was a British colony. The bird is supposed to symbolize progress of the country. The flag has remained unchanged in spite of numerous political changes and upheavals since its adoption.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Before independence in 1962, a committee was formed to choose Uganda’s national symbols.  A contest was held to determine the national anthem; the criterion for the entrants was that the compositions had to be “short, original, solemn, praising and looking forward to the future.”  Despite having recieved several compositions, none were deemed suitable.  The head of the committee then asked George Kakoma, a graduate of Trinity College of Music and Durham University in London, to compose an anthem.  Kakoma came up with the anthem within a day and it was declared the winner in July of that year, a few months before independence; the short length of the work (it is only nine measures in length, one of the shortest national anthems in the world) was one of the biggest advantages it had in being selected.

		<string>The flag of the United States was mentioned for the first time in 1777. Its author was probably Congressman Francis Hopkinson, who took an inspiration from the flag of Sons of Liberty - a group of activists protesting against the introduction of English customs in the American colonies. The thirteen stripes should symbolize the first colonies involved in these fights, originally together with thirteen stars arranged in the circle. The current form of the flag, which was adopted in 1912, kept thirteen stripes indicating the first member states. However, the number of stars increased with accession of new members from 13 to 50. The last star was added in 1960, when Hawaii officially became a part of the US.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>During the war of 1812 (on September 14, 1814), poet Francis Scott Key wrote a poem entitled “Defense of Fort McHenry”, being inspired by seeing the American flag still flying amidst the battle. Key never meant for it to become a song, or a national anthem, yet after showing the poem to his brother in law Judge Joseph H Nicholson, Nicholson noticed the poem could fit the tune “The Anacreontic Song” (also known as “To Anacraeon in Heaven”), a song originally written for a gentlemen’s social club in London, but gained popularity outside Great Britain, including in the United States, where by this time the tune was familiar to American ears. Key may have had this tune in mind when he wrote the poem; an earlier poem of his called “When the Warrior Returns” was also in the same rhythym, could be set to the same tune, and is of similar subject matter – the last two lines of each stanza of that poem also end with “wave” and “brave”.

The poem spread quickly across the United States, the first printing of the poem in a Baltimore paper suggested the “Anacraeon in Heaven” tune, and it stuck. A Baltimore music store owner first printed the song under the title “The Star Spangled Banner.” It gained in popularity, and was made the official tune to accompany flag raisings by the secretary of the Navy in 1889. In 1916 it was ordered to be played at military and other occassions, and, due to a large public relations effort, it was officially adopted by Congress as the first official national anthem of the United States in 1931. There are four verses to the anthem, but it is the first verse that is almost always sung.  (Interestingly, the first verse is a question, only answered by the other three verses).

In addition to countless patriotic songs, there are also state songs for each of the fifty states as well.  Also, the song “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” is considered an unofficial anthem by the African-American community, and is often used by African-American organizations and at events for the African-American community.

1. Oh, say can you see by the dawn’s early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thru the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

2. On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
‘Tis the star-spangled banner!  Oh long may it wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

3. And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out of their foul footsteps’ pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

4. Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war’s desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: “In God is our trust.”
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

		<string>The flag of Uruguay consists of nine horizontal stripes where for of them are blue and five are white. Moreover, the upper left part of the flag is adorned by so-called Sun of May with human face and sixteen rays - eight straight and eight wavy. Nine stripes indicate nine Uruguayan provinces, which were created after the liberation from Brazil in 1828. Prior to Brazilian domination, Uruguay was also ruled by Spanish and Portuguese, and it was called "Banda Oriental" (East Coast). The Sun of May should remind gaining the independence, which took place in May. The design of the flag is probably influenced by the style of American and Argentine flag.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>After Uruguay’s independence in 1828 without a national anthem, the poet Francisco Esteban Acuña de Figueroa offered to write one for the government, and it was accepted as a draft anthem in 1830 and officially approved by the government three years later.  However, like many anthems of the era at the time, it had violent diatribes against Spain (the colonial power over Uruguay) and Portugal and Brazil (Uruguay’s neighbour who annexed the area after a revolt against Spain).  The final version debuted in 1845.  Acuña de Figueroa’s text had 11 verses, but today only the first verse and the chorus is sung.

The music, typical for a Latin American epic anthem is operatic in nature, reminiscent of works by Italian composers Donizetti, Verdi, Bellini or Rossini, but the music was composed by Francisco José Debali, a Hungarian who had moved to Uruguay in 1838 after having served as a military band master in the Piedmont area of Italy.  Acuña de Figueroa’s words were first set to a piece of music by a composer named de Barros, but in 1848 it was set to Debali’s work.  The extended grandeur of the music makes it run very long, even though only one verse is performed today; at 105 bars and almost five minutes in length (if the musical introduction is included), Uruguay’s anthem is the longest in the world.

		<string>The flag of Uzbekistan, which has been adopted in 1991, consists of three horizontal stripes of blue, white and green colors that are separated by two narrower red stripes. On the left side of the upper blue bar, a white crescent and twelve stars are placed. Uzbekistan was the first state that adopted a new flag after the collapse of the USSR, thus confirming the country's sovereignty. Blue is the color typical of Timur, ancient Uzbek ruler, white stands for peace and green symbolizes the greenery of the landscape. Red evokes viability, crescent traditionally marks the Muslim religion of the population and twelve stars represent months of the Islamic calendar.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>When Uzbekistan was a republic of the Soviet Union, it was given its own anthem to use. When independence was proclaimed in 1991, lacking any prior history as a nation or prior national anthem, the old anthem as a Soviet republic, with new lyrics, was adopted a year after independence.

		<string>The “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is the first official anthem of the Vatican after a work known as the “Gran Marcia Trionfale” [Great Triumphal March] by Vittorino Hallmayr, the bandmaster of an Austrian regiment located in Rome, was used on an unofficial basis.  The “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is performed in the presence of: the Pope; one of his special legates; or on occasion of presentation of Credential Letters by a papal nuncio. The music by noted composer Charles-François Gounod was written in 1857 for the jubille anniversary of pope Pius IX. Originally, the anthem had Italian lyrics, Latin lyrics were created later (and slightly modified in 1993) as a way for Catholics around the world to sing it in a common language, and the Italian lyrics are no longer used.  The Latin lyrics were by a Catholic priest, who took inspiration from scripture passages about St. Peter (the first Pope in Catholic tradition).  According to the Vatican, the “Inno e Marcia Pontificale” is not to be understood as a national anthem, but rather as a hymn that speaks to Roman Catholics worldwide; in practice, however, it serves as the anthem for the Vatican State.

		<string>The flag of the island nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines which is located in the Caribbean, is composed of three vertical stripes, where the first one is blue, the middle one is wider and yellow and the last one is green. In the middle of the yellow stripe, there are three green diamonds arranged in the shape of the first letter of the name Vincent. The blue represents the sky and the sea, yellow stands for sunshine and green symbolizes lush vegetation of the islands. Green diamonds refer to the national plurality on the islands and also to a large number of islands. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines were once of interest of France and the Great Britain, but the British won the fight and they dominated the islands until 1979, when the independence was proclaimed.</string>

		<string>First adopted in 1969 when the island group became self-governing, the national anthem was confirmed upon independence in 1979.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines also have a royal anthem, “God Save the Queen”, as they are a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as the head of state.

		<string>Venezuelan flag consists of a horizontal tricolor of yellow, blue, and red. The colors are taken from the flag of the former federation Gran Colombia, whose member was Venezuela along with Colombia and Ecuador from 1819 to 1830. Unlike the other former members, the width of stripes on Venezuelan flag is equal. In the middle of the blue stripe, an arc composed of eight five-pointed stars is located and the upper part in the left side of the flag bears a coat of arms (in case of national flag). The stars represent the seven Venezuelan provinces, which signed an agreement with the dissolution of Gran Colombia. The eighth star, which was added on the flag in 2006, is supposed to represent province Esequiba, which is located in the territory of Guyana and which Venezuela is claiming.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Inspired by the first attempt of the Venezuelans to win their independence in 1810, members of the Patriotic Society in the capital Caracas decided to create a patriotic song to encourage the people in their revolution against Spain. While Venezuelan independence was declared in 1811, both the composer and lyricist of the anthem, still fighting in the revolution, were executed by a Spanish firing squad in 1814.

Different from most other anthems of the area (known in this site as “Latin American epic anthems“), the Venezuelan anthem has been known as the “Venezuelan Marseillaise“, possibly due to its origins.</string>

		<string>The Flag of Vietnam carries colors that are very popular in this part of the world - red and yellow. Red is used as a background and yellow fills the five-pointed star placed in the middle of the flag. The design of the flag refers to the communist past and also it is a symbol of the struggle against the French domination. Each peak of the star represents different population category that contributed to build socialism in Vietnam - peasants, workers, intellectuals, youth, and soldiers. The star should commemorate national unity, which is very important concept for the country that has undergone so many turbulences. Until 1975, Vietnam was divided into northern and southern part, where North Vietnam was supported by China and the USSR and South Vietnam was enjoying the patronage of the USA. After the Vietnam War, the countries have unified again.</string>

		<string>Văn Cao, a noted Vietnamese writer and composer, composed “Tiến quân ca” in 1944 while working for an independentist group. It was published in a newspaper and was well-recieved by the citizens, and was sung often during demonstrations and meetings of the revolutionary council. The provisional government adopted it as the anthem in 1945, becoming the anthem of North Vietnam. In 1976, when unification with South Vietnam occured, “Tiến quân ca” was adopted as the anthem for the entire nation.</string>

Bước chân dồn vang trên đường gập ghềnh xa
Cờ in máu chiến thắng mang hồn nước,
Súng ngoài xa chen khúc quân hành ca.
Đường vinh quang xây xác quân thù,
Thắng gian lao cùng nhau lập chiến khu.
Vì nhân dân chiến đấu không ngừng,
Tiến mau ra sa trường,
Tiến lên, cùng tiến lên.
Nước non Việt Nam ta vững bền.

2. Đoàn quân Việt Nam đi
Sao vàng phấp phới
Dắt giống nòi quê hương qua nơi lầm than
Cùng chung sức phấn đấu xây đời mới,
Đứng đều lên gông xích ta đập tan.
Từ bao lâu ta nuốt căm hờn,
Quyết hy sinh đời ta tươi thắm hơn.
Vì nhân dân chiến đấu không ngừng,
Tiến mau ra sa trường,
Tiến lên, cùng tiến lên.

With the one will to save our Fatherland,
Our hurried steps are sounding on the long and arduous road.
Our flag, red with the blood of victory, bears the spirit of our country.
The distant rumbling of the guns passes over the bodies of our foes.
Overcoming all hardships, together we build our resistance bases.
Ceaselessly for the people’s cause let us struggle,
Let us hasten to the battle-field!
Forward! All together advancing!
Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.

2. Soldiers of Vietnam, we go forward!
The gold star of our flag in the wind
Leading our people, our native land, out of misery and suffering.
Let us join our efforts in the fight for the building of a new life.
Let us stand up and break our chains
For too long have we swallowed our hatred.
Let us keep ready for all sacrifices and our life will be radiant.
Ceaselessly for the people’s cause let us struggle,
Let us hasten to the battle-field!
Forward! All together advancing!
Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.

		<string>Vanuatu is an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean which was known as New Hebrides until 1980. In this year was an independence from France and the UK was achieved. The leaf is divided into three main parts. On the pole side of the flag, a black wedge that divides the rest of the flag into red and green fields is placed. The inner parts of the fields are lined with yellow and black stripes. The wedge additionally carries a symbol of boar tusks and two branches of cycads, which stands for peace and prosperity. The red color of the flag refers to the blood of sacrificial boar as well as to human blood. The green bar represents the islands itself and the black one refers to its soil and Melanesian population. The letter "Y" reminds the shape of the archipelago visible from the height.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Vanuatu gained its independence from both the United Kingdom and France in 1980. (I assume that during the colonial period, both anthems were used, however I do not know how they were performed). Upon independence, the anthem “Yumi, Yumi, Yumi”, written in the native Bislama language (a type of Pigdin English/French hybrid), was chosen as the national anthem.</string>

		<string>The flag of Samoa, which has been adopted in a slightly different form in 1948, is composed of a red sheet with a blue rectangle located on the pole side of the flag stretching to the half of the flag. The rectangle bears five white stars of different sizes, which are reminiscent of the Southern Cross constellation which dominates the night sky in this area. The original flag which was adopted in 1948 contained only four stars, their number was, however, later increased to today´s five. The red color of the leaf refers to the blood shed during the struggle for independence from Germany, which Samoa reached in 1962. The blue color symbolizes unity and justice and the white stands for purity and chastity.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Since the anthem was adopted upon independence in 1962, there has arisen alternative lyrics for some lines of the anthem that stress Christian imagery and divine protection for the nation.  It is unclear when these lyrics were first used, who wrote them, or how official they are, but they have been used with increasing frequency; the nation is almost entirely Christian as well.

		<string>The current flag of Yemen has been adopted in 1990 after the unification of North and South Yemen. Prior to 1990, each part disposed with its own flag - northern Arab Republic was using a flag similar to the present flag but with a green five-pointed star in the middle of the white stripe. The flag of South Yemen's Republic differed by blue triangle and a red five-pointed star on the left side of the flag. After creation of the Republic of Yemen, all different elements were dropped from the common flag as a sign of compromise and unity. Thus, only horizontal tricolor in the pan-Arab colors were kept. The colors red, white and black traditionally represent solidarity with the other Arab states.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>First adopted as the anthem of South Yemen in 1979 (without a title), the anthem was titled “United Republic” and used as the anthem of the entire country when North and South Yemen joined in 1990.

		<string>The flag of South Africa was adopted after the first elections and the end of apartheid in 1994. This is also related to the symbolism of the flag and the letter "Y", which stretches from the left to the right side. It indicates the efforts to bring closer the groups separated for so many years and their common future without conflicts. The variety of colors on the flag stands for the plurality of political and ethnic groups in the country, that is why the flag is sometimes called "rainbow flag". Like on the flag of the African National Congress, three of these colors are black, green and yellow. Red, white and blue represent the Boer republics, and also the colors of political party Zulu are included.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>At the time that South Africa’s multi-racial system of government was adopted, there were two anthems in use among the people, divided by the old racial lines. “N’kosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” (God Bless Africa), written and composed by Enoch Mankayi, was popular with the black population and was used as an anti-Apartheid anthem.  The white South Africans had been using “Die Stem van Suid Afrika” (The Call of South Africa) since the 1920s on an unofficial basis, and was made the country’s official anthem in 1957. Even though the latter anthem was seen as too closely tied to the apartheid system by the majority black population, it was decided in the interim to make both anthems the national anthem, “God Bless Africa” was usually played in its entirety followed by the complete “Die Stem”.

In 1997, the two anthems were combined, and the lyrics reflect South Africa’s multi-racial status in that the lyrics employ five of the most popularly spoken of South Africa’s eleven official languages.  The lyrics start with a few lines of “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika” in Xhosa, then Zulu, followed by Sesotho, then a few lines of “Die Stem” in Afrikaans, and finishing the anthem with another few lines from “The Call of South Africa” in English. (The English lines actually do not appear in the official English version of “Die Stem”, but are an abridgement of the last few lines of the first verse, with the words slightly altered to reflect South Africa’s new freedom).

The national anthem of South Africa is unique in a couple of aspects: first of all, as mentioned above, the anthem employs five different languages in the same version of the official lyrics, secondly, by virtue of the fact that it combines two disparate pieces of music, this anthem as well as Italy’s and that of the Philippines are the only ones that end on a different key than they begins with.

		<string>The base of a flag of Zambia, which has been adopted in 1964, is composed of a green leaf. The flag is unusual by positioning the other symbols on the right side of the flag. We can find there three stripes above which a golden eagle taken from the national coat of arms spreads its wings. The green color reminds lush vegetation and eagle stands for unfailing hope in the hearts of local people. Three stripes in red, black and orange colors were taken from the flag of UNIP party, which led the country during the struggles for independence around 1964. Red stands for the bloodshed during these fights and black represents the African people. The orange color supposedly refers to mineral wealth located in Zambia.</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>Upon independence in 1964, Zambia adopted the melody of “God Bless Africa” for the melody, yet different lyrics were written to specifically reflect Zambia. “God Bless Africa” is a popular song and anthem in southern Africa, the song was also formerly used by Zimbabwe, Ciskei, and Transkei, and currently by Tanzania and as part of the South African anthem.

In 2005, representatives of the Zambian women’s movement wanted the lyrics to the national anthem changed: “free men” changed to “freely” and “brothers” to “all one”.  It was decreed that when the anthem was adopted the masculine gender was used to include females as well, and the anthem was not changed, since the anthem is “composed of historical lyrics that reflect the country’s heritage.”

		<string>The flag of Zimbabwe has been adopted in 1980 and it is composed of seven horizontal stripes. The color sequence is axially symmetrical about the middle black stripe. Coming from the black stripe, there are red, yellow and green stripes. On the left side of the flag, a white wedge that carries a symbol of bird carved in soapstone in the red five-pointed star is placed. The colors were inspired by the flag of the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front, which pushed for gaining independence of the former Rhodesia from Great Britain. The star recalls the origins of socialism in the country and the symbolism of colors is as follows: black represents the African population, the red blood shed during the struggle for independence, yellow mineral wealth and green fruitful landscape. White color traditionally symbolizes peace.</string>

		<string>In 1994, a contest was held for a uniquely Zimbabwean anthem (the anthem then used, “God Bless Africa” was used by at least half a dozen former and current nations and groups in southern Africa). The winning entry was entitled “Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe” in the Ndebele language, “Simudzai Mureza WeZimbabwe” in Shona, and “Blessed Be The Land of Zimbabwe” in English, and had lyrics written for the anthem in all three of the main languages of the country by a leading Zimbabwean poet and academic.

Special thanks to: Jo Hyo-roe for the sheet music.</string>

1. Phakamisan iflegi yethu yeZimbabwe
Eyazalwa yimpi yenkululeko;
Legaz’ elinengi lamaqhawe ethu
Silivikele ezithan izonke; 
Kalibusisiwe ilizwe leZimbabwe. 

2. Khangelan’ iZimbabwe yon’ ihlotshiwe
Ngezintaba lang’ miful’ ebukekayo,
Izulu kaline, izilimo zande; 
Iz’ sebenzi zenam’, abantu basuthe;
Kalibusisiwe ilizwe leZimbabwe. 

3. Nkosi busis’ ilizwe lethu leZimbabwe
Ilizwe labokhokho bethu thina sonke; 
Kusuk’ eZambezi kusiy’ eLimpopo 
Abakhokheli babe lobuqotho; 
Kalibusisiwe ilizwe leZimbabwe.

1. Simudzai mureza wedu weZimbabwe
Yakazvarwa nomoto wechimurenga;
Neropa zhinji ramagamba
Tiidzivirire kumhandu dzose;
Ngaikomborerwe nyika yeZimbabwe. 

2. Tarisai Zimbabwe nyika yakashongedzwa
Namakomo, nehova, zvinoyevedza 
Mvura ngainaye, minda ipe mbesa 
Vashandi vatuswe, ruzhinji rugutswe;
Ngaikomborerwe nyika yeZimbabwe. 

3. Mwari ropafadzai nyika yeZimbabwe
Nyika yamadzitateguru edu tose; 
Kubva Zambezi kusvika Limpopo, 
Navatungamiri vave nenduramo; 
Ngaikomborerwe nyika yeZimbabwe.

1. O lift high the banner, the flag of Zimbabwe,
The symbol of freedom proclaiming victory;
We praise our heroes’ sacrifice,
And vow to keep our land from foes;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
 
2. O lovely Zimbabwe, so wondrously adorned
With mountains, and rivers cascading, flowing free;
May rain abound, and fertile fields;
May we be fed, our labour blessed;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
 
3. O God, we beseech Thee to bless our native land;
The land of our fathers bestowed upon us all;
From Zambezi to Limpopo
May leaders be exemplary;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
